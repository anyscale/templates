    "This template shows you how to:\n",
    "1. Read in data from in-memory samples or files on cloud storage. \n",
    "2. Use Ray Data and vLLM to run batch inference of a LLM.\n",

    "### How to decide between online vs offline inference for LLM\n",
    "Online LLM inference (e.g. Anyscale Endpoint) should be used when you want to get real-time response for prompt or to interact with the LLM. Use online inference when you want to optimize latency of inference to be as quick as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, offline LLM inference (also referred to as batch inference) should be used when you want to get reponses for a large number of prompts within some time frame, but not required to be real-time (minutes to hours granularity). Use offline inference when you want to:\n",
    "1. Scale your workload to large-scale datasets\n",
    "2. Optimize inference throughput and resource usage (for example, maximizing GPU utilization).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on the latter, using offline LLM inference for a sentence completion task."
