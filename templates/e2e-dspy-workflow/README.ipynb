    "- Evaluation\n",

    "## Scenario: Cost-Effective Customer Support Query Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider an example of classification with limited labelled data. The specific dataset we'll be working with is the [PolyAI/banking77](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/banking77) dataset, which consists of customer support queries for a bank. We'll simulate a scenario with low labelled data: let's say we have a dataset has limited labeled data (100 queries) and 4,000 unlabeled customer queries. We'll build a solution that leverages DSPy on Anyscale to distill knowledge from a 70B model into a more cost-effective 1B model, making it practical for production deployment.\n",

    "- DSPy enables easy creation of a pipeline for knowledge distillation from a 70B model to a 1B model in a low data environment\n",
