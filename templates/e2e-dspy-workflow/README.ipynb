    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "You are a bank, and you want to categorize customer support queries into one of 25 categories. You have hand labeled 100 examples and have collected 4,000 unlabeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to use an LLM to solve this problem, because you don't have enough labeled data to train a traditional classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "You also don't want to spend a lot of money on inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "You decide to use DSPy to solve this problem because the following flow is fairly difficult to orchestrate manually:\n",
    "Data Collection/Labeling -> Fine-tuning -> Prompt Optimization -> Evaluation -> Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "By using DSPy on Anyscale, you can easily orchestrate this flow and solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't want pay to host a 70B model, so you will instead finetune a 1B model, which you can host and serve at a low cost using Anyscale's RayLLM offering.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to help the 1B model understand the reasoning behind why the 70B model makes certain classifications, you will use Chains of Thought to distill knowledge from the 70B model.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what will this look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect 4,000 unlabeled examples\n",
    "2. Label all of them with your 70B oracle model running locally\n",
    "3. Use the new DSPy finetuning tools to finetune a 1B model\n",
    "- This takes about 20 minutes on 4xA100-80GB GPUs, and uses Anyscale's LLMForge in the background to finetune the model\n",
    "4. Evaluate and prompt optimize your 1B model checkpoints against the labeled dataset\n",
    "5. Take the best performing 1B checkpoint and compare it to the un-finetuned 1B model on the true test set\n",
    "6. Deploy the optimized 1B model/DSPy pipeline to production using Anyscale's RayLLM # TODO\n",
    "\n",
    "Note(isaac): we arent doing anything with the 100 labeled examples yet"

    "1. Remember to set your HF_TOKEN and HF_HOME environment variables\n",

    "\n",
    "We've chosen pipeline parallelism and tensor parallelism of 2 for the 70B model based on our current setup. Here's the reasoning:\n",

    "1. Model size: The 70B model has 30 parts of ~5 GB each (based on [HuggingFace documentation](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct/tree/main)).\n",
    "   - Total size: 30 * 5 GB = 150 GB\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Available VRAM:\n",
    "   - Our GPUs: 80 GB VRAM x 4 = 320 GB\n",
    "   - Tensor parallelism: floor(320/150) = 2\n",
    "   - Pipeline parallelism: floor(num_gpus/2) = 2\n",
    "   - To use all 4 GPUs efficiently:\n",
    "     - Pipeline parallel size: 2\n",
    "     - Tensor parallelism: 2\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Alternative setup (8x24GB GPUs):\n",
    "   - Pipeline parallel size: 1\n",
    "   - Tensor parallelism: ceil(150/24) = 7\n",
    "\n",
    "This configuration allows us to run the 70B model efficiently across our available GPU resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on Anyscale, you CANNOT download a model without changing HF_HOME on most machines. The folder `/mnt/local_storage/' has enough space for a model download. It is not persisted across cluster restarts, but that is fine for model weights we don't need to save."
