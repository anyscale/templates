The method can be described as the FTCS (forward in time, centered in space) scheme with an artificial viscosity term of 1\/2. One can view the Lax\u2013Friedrichs method as an alternative to Godunov's scheme, where one avoids solving a Riemann problem at each cell interface, at the expense of adding artificial viscosity.",
