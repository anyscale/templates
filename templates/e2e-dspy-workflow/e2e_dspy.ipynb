    "# Let's break down the BasicMH program\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Design\n",
    "The BasicMH program is designed to answer complex questions requiring multiple retrieval steps without relying on the model's internal knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we asked \"What the capital of the country that has the eiffel tower\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The model cannot just throw the original question \"What the capital of the country that has the eiffel tower\" into a retriever, the model needs to generate a query with the right search terms in order to get the correct passages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Flow:\n",
    "1. Iterate through the specified number of hops:\n",
    "\n",
    "   a. Generate a search query using `generate_query` modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "   b. Retrieve passages using the `retrieve` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "   c. Deduplicate and add retrieved passages to the context.\n",
    "2. After completing all hops, generate the final answer using the `generate_answer` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "This multi-step approach enables the program to break down complex questions and gather necessary information incrementally, improving the accuracy of the final answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### `BasicMH` class\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `__init__` method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method initializes the class with the specified number of hops and passages per hop. It also sets up the `retrieve` module for passage retrieval and a list of `generate_query` modules for generating search queries at each hop. It should be noted that each hop has a different generate_query module, which means they all get optimized separately. The intuition here is that a good prompt for the first hop may not be good for the second hop, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `forward` method\n",
    "\n",
    "This method implements the forward pass of the program. It iterates through the specified number of hops, generating a search query at each hop and retrieving passages. The retrieved passages are then deduplicated and added to the context. After completing all hops, it generates the final answer using the `generate_answer` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note here is that you directly return the result of the `generate_answer` module. A common anti-pattern is to return `prediction.answer` instead of `prediction`. This is because `prediction` is an object that contains information that is useful for optimization, and the answer can be extracted later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how to use the `BasicMH` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "program = BasicMH()\n",
    "prediction = program(question=\"What is the capital of the country that has the Eiffel Tower?\")\n",

The program uses a chain of thought approach, where each hop represents a step in the reasoning process, and the output of each hop is used as input for the next hop. The program seems to be designed to simulate how a human would answer a question, by thinking step by step and generating intermediate search queries and answers.\n",

All were executed at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole mental asylum at Saint-Rémy near Arles, France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890. The works were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the Alpilles mountains.', 'Green Wheat Field with Cypress | Green Wheat Field with Cypress (French: Champ de blé vert avec cyprès) is an oil on canvas painting by a Dutch Post-Impressionist Vincent van Gogh. It was completed in 1889, while van Gogh was voluntarily incarcerated at the asylum of St. Paul near Saint-Rémy in Provence. Several paintings of wheat fields with cypresses were made when van Gogh was able to leave the asylum grounds and explore the local landscape. Besides a fondness for cypresses, van Gogh had a special affinty with wheat fields; he depicted them dozens of times over the years; to Vincent they symbolized the cycle of life and death, and he found in them both solace and inspiration.', 'Olive Trees (Van Gogh series) | Vincent van Gogh painted at least 18 paintings of olive trees, mostly in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence in 1889. At his own request, he lived at an asylum there from May 1889 through May 1890 painting the gardens of the asylum and, when he had permission to venture outside its walls, nearby olive trees, cypresses and wheat fields.', 'Wheat Fields (Van Gogh series) | The Wheat Fields is a series of dozens of paintings by Vincent van Gogh, borne out of his religious studies and sermons, connection to nature, appreciation of manual laborers and desire to provide a means of offering comfort to others. The wheat field works demonstrate his progression as an artist from the drab \"Wheat Sheaves\" made in 1885 in the Netherlands to the colorful, dramatic paintings from Arles, Saint-Rémy and Auvers-sur-Oise of rural France.']\n",

Specifically, it is designed to generate answers based on a given context and question. The program works by first generating a search query based on the context and question, and then retrieving relevant passages from the search query. It then generates the answer by combining the context and retrieved passages. The program uses a multi-hop approach, where it repeatedly generates search queries, retrieves passages, and combines them to generate the final answer. The program's output field is the answer to the question, along with a rationale for the answer.\n",

Tucker worked as a vaudeville straight man, aged fifteen years old. A mentor provided funds and contacts for a trip to California, where party hostess Cobina Wright persuaded guest Wesley Ruggles to give Tucker a screen test, based on his photogenic good looks, thick wavy hair and height of six feet, five inches - putting him into the same league as John Wayne, Chuck Connors, Fess Parker, James Arness, and Peter Graves, Arness's younger brother. Tucker was a sight reader who needed only one take. His film career started well despite a perception in most Hollywood studios that blond men were not photogenic. After twenty years spent mainly in Westerns and action roles, he returned to his roots, showing versatility as a comedic and stage musical actor.

      "[1] «Forrest Tucker | Forrest Meredith Tucker (February 12, 1919 – October 25, 1986) was an American actor in both movies and television who appeared in nearly a hundred films. Tucker worked as a vaudeville straight man, aged fifteen years old. A mentor provided funds and contacts for a trip to California, where party hostess Cobina Wright persuaded guest Wesley Ruggles to give Tucker a screen test, based on his photogenic good looks, thick wavy hair and height of six feet, five inches - putting him into the same league as John Wayne, Chuck Connors, Fess Parker, James Arness, and Peter Graves, Arness's younger brother. Tucker was a sight reader who needed only one take. His film career started well despite a perception in most Hollywood studios that blond men were not photogenic. After twenty years spent mainly in Westerns and action roles, he returned to his roots, showing versatility as a comedic and stage musical actor. In the TV show \"F Troop\", he became identified with the character of Cavalry Sgt. Morgan O'Rourke (a manipulative character quite similar to Phil Silvers' role as MSgt Ernie Bilko). Tucker struggled with a drinking problem that began to affect his performances in the later years of his career.»\n",

      "[1] «Forrest Tucker | Forrest Meredith Tucker (February 12, 1919 – October 25, 1986) was an American actor in both movies and television who appeared in nearly a hundred films. Tucker worked as a vaudeville straight man, aged fifteen years old. A mentor provided funds and contacts for a trip to California, where party hostess Cobina Wright persuaded guest Wesley Ruggles to give Tucker a screen test, based on his photogenic good looks, thick wavy hair and height of six feet, five inches - putting him into the same league as John Wayne, Chuck Connors, Fess Parker, James Arness, and Peter Graves, Arness's younger brother. Tucker was a sight reader who needed only one take. His film career started well despite a perception in most Hollywood studios that blond men were not photogenic. After twenty years spent mainly in Westerns and action roles, he returned to his roots, showing versatility as a comedic and stage musical actor. In the TV show \"F Troop\", he became identified with the character of Cavalry Sgt. Morgan O'Rourke (a manipulative character quite similar to Phil Silvers' role as MSgt Ernie Bilko). Tucker struggled with a drinking problem that began to affect his performances in the later years of his career.»\n",
