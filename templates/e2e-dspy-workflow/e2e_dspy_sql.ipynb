The task involves transforming a user's natural language query into a structured SQL query that can be executed on a database.

It then uses a Chain of Thought model, which is a type of language model that generates intermediate reasoning steps, to generate a SQL query and the reasoning behind it. The program provides the final SQL query and the reasoning steps as output, allowing users to understand how the query was generated.\n",

      "PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: This program is designed to solve the task of converting natural language queries into SQL queries, also known as Text-to-SQL. The program appears to work by using a language model to generate SQL queries based on input natural language queries and their corresponding contexts. The program follows a step-by-step reasoning process to produce the SQL query. This process involves filtering data based on specific conditions, aggregating data using functions such as SUM and MAX, and grouping data as needed. The program provides a clear rationale for the generated SQL query, explaining the reasoning process and the SQL operations used to produce the desired output.\n",

However, we need to be careful because the problem statement does not explicitly state whether we should return the maximum amount for each country separately or the overall maximum amount.

    "- '--port 8000': Sets the server port to 8000\n",
    "- '--pipeline_parallel_size 4': Enables pipeline parallelism with 4 stages\n",
    "- '--enable_prefix_caching': Enables caching of prefixes for faster inference\n",
    "- '--enable_lora': Enables LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) for fine-tuning\n",
    "- '--lora_modules mhqa-lora=/mnt/local_storage/dspy/mhqa-lora': Specifies the name of the LoRA module and the path to the LoRA weights. We use the name instead of the base model name when trying to use the LoRA weights. If we just use the base model name, the server will ignore the LoRA weights.\n",
    "\n",
