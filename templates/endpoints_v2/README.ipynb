    "\n",
    "You can also find more advanced tutorials in the `cookbooks/` folder, including those for:\n",
    "- Embedding generation\n",
    "- Deploying custom models\n",
    "- Deploying LoRA and function-calling models\n",
    "- Deploying vision language models\n",
    "- How to configure autoscaling and other optimization parameters\n",

    "\n",
    "We provide a starter command to run Llama and Mistral-family models via Ray Serve. You can specify the arguments, such as Lora, GPU type and tensor parallelism via the command. You can also follow the [guide](cookbooks/CustomModels.ipynb) to bring your own models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that if you would like to serve a model whose architecture is different from the provided list of models, we highly recommend you manually going over the generated model config file to provide the correct values."
