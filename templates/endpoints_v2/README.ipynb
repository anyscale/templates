    "\n",
    "This template comes with a library for serving OSS LLMs on Anyscale called [RayLLM](https://docs.anyscale.com/llms/serving/intro).\n",
    "\n",
    "RayLLM provides a number of features that simplify LLM development, including:\n",
    "- An extensive suite of pre-configured open source LLMs.\n",
    "- An OpenAI-compatible REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as operational features to efficiently scale LLM apps:\n",
    "- Optimizations such as continuous batching, quantization and streaming.\n",
    "- Production-grade autoscaling support, including scale-to-zero.\n",
    "- Native multi-GPU & multi-node model deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This template explains how to set up, run, and query LLMs with RayLLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about RayLLM, check out [the docs](https://docs.anyscale.com/llms/serving/intro). If you're interested in fine-tuning, check out the [fine-tuning template](https://console.anyscale.com/v2/template-preview/finetuning_llms_v2).\n",

    "\n",
    "RayLLM takes in a config that specifies the model you wish to serve, as well as its settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the RayLLM CLI in the workspace terminal to generate the config:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "rayllm gen-config\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** This command requires interactive inputs and should be executed directly in the terminal, not within a Jupyter notebook cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command lets you pick from a common set of OSS LLMs and helps you configure them. You can tune settings like GPU type, tensor parallelism, and autoscaling parameters. Check out [the docs](https://docs.anyscale.com/llms/serving/guides/bring_any_model) to learn how to bring your own models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that if you're configuring a model whose architecture is different from the provided list of models, we recommend that you closely review the generated model config file to provide the correct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command generates 2 files - an LLM config file (saved in `model_config/`) and a Ray Serve config file (`serve_TIMESTAMP.yaml`) that you can reference and re-run in the future."
