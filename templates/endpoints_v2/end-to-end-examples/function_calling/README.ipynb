    "# Build Tool Calling Feature for Any LLM via JSON Mode\n",
    "**⏱️ Time to complete**: 20 min\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling (aka Function calling) allows you to hook up external tools to an LLM, enabling it to use APIs and other tools to perform tasks. This feature is particularly useful when you want to extend the capabilities of an LLM beyond its internal knowledge base. In this example we want to see how we can use [JSON Mode](docs.anyscale.com/latest/llms/serving/guides/json_mode) to enable this capability for *Any* LLM. "

    "## How Tool Calling Works?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how tool calling typically works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You input a query, specifying a list of functions alongside their parameters and descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The LLM evaluates whether to activate a function. If it opts not to, it responds in natural language – either providing an answer based on its internal knowledge or seeking clarifications about the query and tool usage. If it decides to use a tool, it suggests the appropriate API and details on how to employ it, all formatted in JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. You then execute the API call in your application and return the response back to the LLM and have it analyze the results and continue with the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tool calling can be enabled by one of the two following approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fine-tuning**: You can fine-tune an LLM to use tools when prompted in a specific way. Many recently released open-weight models have gone through some stages of post-training and out-of-the-box come with the capability of using tools. For examples, `mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1` or `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` natively support tool calling since they have been fine-tuned to do so via a special prompt format. To use these models, you need to specify the tool-compatible prompt format in your model config YAML. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for `mistralai/Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1` here is the prompt format used to enable tool calling (see the full config [here](./model_config/mistralai--Mixtral-8x22B-Instruct-v0_1.yaml)):\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "    prompt_format:\n",
    "        system: \"{instruction}\\n\\n \"\n",
    "        assistant: \"{tool_calls}{instruction} </s> \"\n",
    "        # Special part of assistant message (shows the previous assistant message that was a tool call).\n",
    "        tool_calls: \" [TOOL_CALLS] {instruction}\"\n",
    "        # Special new role that should trigger the model to ingest results of tool calls\n",
    "        tool: \"[TOOL_RESULTS] {instruction} [/TOOL_RESULTS]\"\n",
    "        # The format of the available tools that for mixtral goes into the last user message\n",
    "        tools_list: \"[AVAILABLE_TOOLS] {instruction} [/AVAILABLE_TOOLS] \"\n",
    "        trailing_assistant: \"\"\n",
    "        user: \"{tools_list}[INST] {system}{instruction} [/INST]\"\n",
    "        # Only one BOS is added at the beginning of the entire conversation\n",
    "        bos: \"<s> \"\n",
    "        system_in_user: true\n",
    "        # Similar to system_in_user, if true it preprends available tools to the user message.\n",
    "        tools_list_in_user: true\n",
    "        # If true it will only prepend this message to the last user. \n",
    "        system_in_last_user: true\n",
    "        # If true it will only prepend this message to the last user. \n",
    "        tools_list_in_last_user: true\n",
    "        add_system_tags_even_if_message_is_empty: false\n",
    "        strip_whitespace: true\n",
    "        default_system_message: \"Always assist with care, respect, and truth. Respond with utmost utility yet securely. Avoid harmful, unethical, prejudiced, or negative content. Ensure replies promote fairness and positivity.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this prompt format, and deploying the model using RayLLM you can get an openAI compatible tool support for this model. The full config can be generated by rayllm's config generator tool (`rayllm gen-config`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JSON Mode**: Not all models come with tool calling capabilities out of the box. In such cases, you can use JSON Mode to enable tool calling. JSON Mode allows you to make the output of LLMs structured and predictable. In this example, we show how to use this feature to build an LLM client that can understand tools in a similar API to OpenAI SDK."
