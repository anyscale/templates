You can go through the below steps if your model isn't based on one of the provided model architectures and prefer to construct the model config yaml yourself. We have also provided some starter yaml files and you can edit the model to the specific model file that you created. Once you create the model YAML files, you will need to add these model YAMLs into a config file similar to `llm-serve-aws.yaml` that can deployed locally or to an Anyscale Service.\n"

    "### Prompt Format\n",
    "A prompt format is used to convert a chat completions API input into a prompt to feed into the LLM engine. The format is a dictionary where the key refers to one of the chat actors and the value is a string template for which to convert the content of the message into a string. Each message in the API input is formated into a string and these strings are assembled together to form the final prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string template should include the `{instruction}` keyword, which will be replaced with message content from the ChatCompletions API.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a user sends the following message for llama2-7b-chat-hf ([prompt format](models/llama/meta-llama--Llama-2-7b-chat-hf_a10g_tp1.yaml#L30-L36)):\n",

    "* `assistant` - The assistant message. These messages are from the past turns of the assistant as defined in the list of messages provided in the ChatCompletions API.\n",
    "* `trailing_assistant` - The special characters that will be added to the end of the prompt before sending it to the LLM for generation. This often includes special characters that put the LLM into assitant mode (granted that model has been trained to support such special keywords). For example [vicuna](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-13B-v1.5-GGML) has `Assistant: ` as a special tag that can go here.\n",
    "* `user` - The user message. This is the messages of the user as defined in the list of messages provided in the ChatCompletions API.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there some configurations to control the prompt formatting behavior:\n",
    "* `default_system_message` - The default system message. This system message is used by default if one is not provided in the ChatCompletions API.\n",
    "* `system_in_user` - Whether the system prompt should be included in the user prompt. If true, the user field should include '{system}'.\n",
    "* `add_system_tags_even_if_message_is_empty` - Whether to include the system tags even if the user message is empty.\n",
    "* `strip_whitespace` - Whether to automatically strip whitespace from left and right of the content for the messages provided in the ChatCompletions API."
