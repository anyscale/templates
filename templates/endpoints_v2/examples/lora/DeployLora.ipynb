    "# Serving LoRA Models\n",
    "\n",
    "We support serving multiple LoRA adapters with a common base model in the same request batch which allows you to serve a wide variety of use-cases without increasing hardware spend. In addition, we use Serve multiplexing to reduce the number of swaps for LoRA adapters. There is a slight latency overhead to serving a LoRA model compared to the base model, typically 10-20%.\n",
    "\n",
    "We generally recommend running the starter script via ``python main.py`` to enable LoRA serving and it allows you to specify your own LoRA weights URI as well. You can use the below steps to understand the key fields in the model config and prefer to modify the yaml file yourself."

    "You can use the `generate_config.py` script to generate a sample model configuration and Ray Serve configuration file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important field of note is the `dynamic_lora_loading_path` in the Ray Serve configuration file - The LoRA checkpoints are loaded from the artifact storage path specified in `dynamic_lora_loading_path`. The path to the checkpoints must be in the following format: `{dynamic_lora_loading_path}/{base_model_id}:{suffix}:{id}`, e.g. `s3://my-bucket/my-lora-checkouts/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf:lora-model:1234`. The models can be loaded from any accessible AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage bucket. You can use an existing bucket where you have the LoRA models or can upload the models to `$ANYSCALE_ARTIFACT_STORAGE` already provided by Anyscale Workspace. New models can be uploaded to the `dynamic_lora_loading_path` dynamically before or after the Serve application is launched."
