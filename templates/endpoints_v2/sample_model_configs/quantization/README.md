This guide demonstrates model quantization techniques using Ray Serve and vLLM to reduce memory usage and computational costs for large language model deployment.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this guide, you will master:

- **Why quantization matters**: Reduce model memory requirements by 50-75% while maintaining accuracy for cost-effective deployment
- **Ray Serve's quantization superpowers**: Seamless integration with vLLM quantization methods for optimal resource utilization
- **Production optimization strategies**: Industry-standard techniques used by major AI companies to deploy large models efficiently
- **Cost optimization techniques**: Quantization strategies that enable deployment on smaller, cheaper hardware configurations

## Overview: Model Optimization Challenge

**Challenge**: Large language models consume significant computational resources:
- Full-precision models require expensive high-memory GPUs
- Inference costs can be prohibitive for large-scale applications
- Memory limitations restrict model size and batch processing capabilities

**Solution**: Quantization reduces resource requirements while maintaining performance:
- Represents weights and activations with lower-precision data types (4-bit vs 16-bit)
- Enables deployment on cheaper hardware with potentially lower inference costs
- Integrates seamlessly with vLLM for optimized quantized inference

**Impact**: Organizations using quantization achieve:
- **50-75% memory reduction** enabling deployment on smaller GPU instances
- **30-60% cost reduction** through more efficient hardware utilization
- **Maintained model accuracy** with minimal performance degradation

## Quantization Methods

Anyscale supports AWQ and SqueezeLLM weight-only quantization through vLLM integration. Quantization can be enabled by specifying the `quantization` method in `engine_kwargs` and using a quantized model for `model_id` and `hf_model_id`. 

See the configuration examples in this directory for quantization implementations. Note that AWQ and SqueezeLLM quantization methods in vLLM may be slower than FP16 models for larger batch sizes due to ongoing optimization work.
