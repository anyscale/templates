    "2. The prompt format is configured such that no formating is applied during data ingestion. We are simply concatenating the message roles. Therefore, the formatting of inputs is completely delegated to formatting of the examples in the dataset. \n",
    "3. We need to format the data, to make it look like the Llama-Guard-2's original prompt format, so that we can maximally leverage its pre-trained weights. We can take a look at an example from this dataset. During inference we need to send our messages in the same way."

    "## How prompt formatting works in `llmforge`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a quick rundown of how prompt formatting or chat templating works: the training or validation data needs to be formatted in the OpenAI messages format. Each example has a \"messages\" entry consisting a conversation with \"system\", \"user\" and \"assistant\" roles. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json \n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"messages\": [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant\"}, \n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What's the value of 1+1?\"}, \n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"The value is 2\"}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For each role, depending on the model, we add certain tokens as headers or footers along with a BOS token at the start of the conversation and an EOS token at the end of each assistant response. This templating/ formatting is a crucial preprocessing step in bringing the conversation format into a plain text input - which is later tokenized and fed into the model. For Llama-3-8B, the above example would be formatted as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "<|begin_of_text|><|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nYou are a helpful assistant<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nWhat's the value of 1+1?<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\nThe value is 2<|eot_id|>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt format can be specified in our YAML as a part of the `generation_config` for the model (the same format is used in our inference code):\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \n",
    "    user: \n",
    "    assistant:\n",
    "    trailing_assistant:  # inference-only\n",
    "    bos: # optional\n",
    "    system_in_user: # optional\n",
    "    default_system_message: # optional\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the native models in the [list of supported models](../../README.md#faqs), we have default generation config parameters. This means that `generation_config` need not be specified when you just want to finetune a model like `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct` directly.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "For `meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B`, we use the following prompt format:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",

    "    system: \"<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n{instruction}<|eot_id|>\"\n",
    "    user: \"<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n{instruction}<|eot_id|>\"\n",
    "    assistant: \"\"\"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n{instruction}<|eot_id|>\"\n",
    "    trailing_assistant: \"<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\\n\\n\" # inference-only \n",
    "    bos: \"<|begin_of_text|>\"\n",
    "    system_in_user: False\n",
    "    default_system_message: \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For `mistralai/Mistral-7B`, we the below prompt format:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \"{instruction} + \"\n",
    "    user: \"[INST] {system}{instruction} [/INST]\"\n",
    "    assistant: \" {instruction}</s>\"\n",
    "    trailing_assistant: \"\" # inference-only \n",
    "    bos: \"<s>\"\n",
    "    system_in_user: True\n",
    "    default_system_message: \"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information on each entry in the [config API reference](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/finetuning-config-api). Each `system`, `user` and `asistant` entry must contain the format specifier `{instruction}` which will actually format the corresponding entry in `messages`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Customizing data preprocessing and the prompt format\n",
    "\n",
    "Different LLMs are trained with different prompt formats (or chat templates). In order to figure out the right way to format your data and choose the config parameters, we need to work backwards from the text input to the model. For Llama Guard 2, for instance, the format that the model is trained with is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "<|begin_of_text|>[INST] Task: Check if there is unsafe content in '{{ role }}' messages in conversations according our safety policy with the below categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "{{ unsafe_categories }}\n",
    "<END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "\n",
    "<BEGIN CONVERSATION>\n",
    "\n",
    "User: {{ user_message_1 }}\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: {{ model_answer_1 }}\n",
    "\n",
    "<END CONVERSATION>\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide your safety assessment for ONLY THE LAST {{ role }} in the above conversation:\n",
    "- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.\n",
    "- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of violated categories. [/INST]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is wildly different from Llama-3's prompt format. Fortunately, the OpenAI conversation format is highly flexible and adaptable to almost any input. In a case like Llama Guard 2, it is beneficial to take control of the templating yourself and format your inputs beforehand in the data preprocessing stage. For example, here's one way your data can look:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"messages\": [\n",
    "    {\"role\": \"system\", \n",
    "    \"content\": \"<|begin_of_text|>[INST] Task: Check if there is unsafe content in '{{ role }}' messages in conversations according our safety policy with the below categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "<BEGIN UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "{{ unsafe_categories }}\n",
    "<END UNSAFE CONTENT CATEGORIES>\n",
    "\n",
    "<BEGIN CONVERSATION>\n",
    "\n",
    "User: {{ user_message_1 }}\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent: {{ model_answer_1 }}\n",
    "\n",
    "<END CONVERSATION>\n",
    "\n",
    "\",\n",
    "  }, \n",
    "    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\":  \"Provide your safety assessment for ONLY THE LAST {{ role }} in the above conversation:\n",
    "- First line must read 'safe' or 'unsafe'.\n",
    "- If unsafe, a second line must include a comma-separated list of violated categories. [/INST]\"}, \n",
    "    {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"{expected_response}\"}\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: All the entries in the messages list need to have non-empty content, and at a minimum we expect one user and one assistant message. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we've taken care of the full templating ourselves, we just need the prompt formatter to verbatim concatenate the content in different roles. Thus, the generation config can look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "generation_config:\n",
    "  prompt_format:\n",
    "    system: \"{instruction}\"\n",
    "    user: \"{instruction}\"\n",
    "    assistant: \"{instruction}<|end_of_text|>\"\n",
    "    trailing_assistant: \"\"\n",
    "    bos: \"\" # optional, empty string by default\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above example, the \"instruction\" (format specifier) passed in to the `system` template is almost the entire prompt (mainly problem context), the \"instruction\" passed in to the `user` template contains the specific instructions for the LLM, and the \"instruction\" passed in to the `assistant` template is the expected response ('safe' or 'unsafe'). Also note that this is only one of the many possibilites of `prompt_format` you can specify (with your data preprocessing changing accordingly). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference time behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "After customizing the prompt format during fine-tuning, you need to make sure that the same format is being used at inference. You can use the [inference template](https://docs.anyscale.com/examples/deploy-llms) to deploy your fine-tuned model and specify the same prompt format parameters under  the `generation` entry in the YAML.
