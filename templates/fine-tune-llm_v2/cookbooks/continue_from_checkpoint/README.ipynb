    "This allows us to sequentially combine fine-tuning on multiple datasets in order to get performance boost on the final task that we care about. \n",
    "\n",
    "We support both Full-parameter checkpoints, and LoRA-adapter checkpoints. However, we recommend not to combine the two by training a full-parameter model followed by a LoRA adaptation. Serving the resulting LoRA adapter will require the base full-parameter checkpoint. Unless you are fine-tuning many such LoRA adaptors for different tasks, this serving architecture does not have the neither the economical benefits of LoRA nor the quality benefits of full-parameter.\n",

    "# Things to Notice\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing the training and evaluation loss of the second (continued) fine-tuning with the first run, you'll notice that the values are lower.\n",
    "For instance, the checkpoint in the llama-3-8b.yaml has an evaluation loss of 0.8886.\n",
    "After continued fine-tuning, we achieve a checkpoint with an evaluation loss of 0.8668.\n",
    "It's important to note that the significance of such loss values varies greatly depending on the task at hand. A difference of 0.0218 may represent a substantial improvement for some tasks, while it may only be a minor improvement for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether continued fine-tuning is beneficial for your specific task, we recommend monitoring the training and evaluation loss during the fine-tuning process.\n",
    "This will help you assess the impact of the additional fine-tuning on your model's performance."

    "### In what order should I fine-tune?\n",
    "\n",
    "In general: Finish with the dataset that is closest to what you want during inference.\n",
    "If you are extending the context of the model beyond its native context length, you should start with the smallest context length end with the largest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Should I extend the dataset samples or replace them with new ones when I continue fine-tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "This depends on your task and how many epochs have already been trained. If in doubt, you can always watch the training and evaluation loss to see if you are overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How can I fine-tune a model that I fine-tuned on Anyscale Endpoints?\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to download the model weights through the `Serving` page, upload them to a bucket of your choice and reference the bucket as an initial checkpoint in the training config yaml.\n",
