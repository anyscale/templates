To view the full set of customizable parameters, head over to the [fine-tuning config API reference](https://docs.anyscale.com/reference/finetuning-config-api).

    "## GPU resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuring GPU resources to be used is one of the most important pre-requisities for training. There are two fields in our YAML that are relevant:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "num_devices: 16 # number of GPUs \n",
    "worker_resources:\n",
    "  accelerator_type:A10G: 0.001 # specifies GPU type available, and a minimum allocation per worker\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, our fine-tuning code will launch Ray workers with each being allocated one GPU. The cluster will be auto-scaled if needed to meet the requirements. The different GPU types you can specify can depend on the specific Anyscale Cloud. The value you specify for the accelerator type (0.001 here) does not matter much, as long as it is non-zero (so that each worker is allocated a GPU) and less than or equal to 1 (so that the requested number of GPUs is the same as `num_devices`)."

For the hardware you specify, the amount you can push `train_batch_size_per_device` or `eval_batch_size_per_device` depends on dataset statistics (average sequence length) and the context length used. For a context length of 512 and the default NVIDIA A10 GPUs, the per-device batch size of 16 is a good default for 7B/8B models. "

If `min_num_update_steps` is set to 100 (the default), then the number of epochs is set to be `ceil(100/24) = 5`. "
