So within this limitation you also want to 1) unblock yourself (even if it means more $/flops) and 2) optimize for best configuration while maintaining the quality of the models.\n",

In this cookbook, we will discuss the parameters that are exposed that can help squeeze more flops out of GPUs and train models faster. "

If you use `longest`, you may observe that you did not OOM for a few iteration but then OOMed in a later iteration and you might miss that during initial profiling. This is because the context length of the batch can vary at every iteration and we want to remove that as a confounding factor, so in the config YAML make sure you have the following:\n",

    "Ray Train allows users to specify a different set of resources for rank-0 vs. other ranks. Rank-0 is responsible for checkpoining and normally needs more CPU RAM than the other workers at the time of checkpointing, because of the implementation details around weight aggregation. In a heterogenous multi-node setting where you have both small nodes and large nodes with the same GPUs this can cause a problem, because it becomes important where rank-0 is stored and the cluster is not symetrically used all the time. \n",

During checkpoining a large model like 70B, the CPU RAM on g5.4xlarge is not sufficient and hence we have to define `memory` requirement for `trained_resources` to ensure that the large instance gets picked for rank-0. For example let's look at `./training_configs/full_param/llama-3-70b.yaml`:\n",

    "This configs is asking for 32xA10G GPUs but does not specify the architecture (e.g. `g5.4xlarge` vs. `g5.48xlarge`). However, it specifies that there should be at least 130G of memory available for rank-0, which forces the Anyscale's instance manager to pick g5.48xlarge for rank-0 and any other A10s for other workers hence not hitting RAM OOM issues during checkpointing. This is much better than being forced to use `4xg5.48xlarge` nodes. They may not be available on-demand and might be more expensive too."

So the GPUs would remain in their high-performant regime even if batch size is seemingly small.\n",
