    "# Preference Tuning for Summarization using Synthetic Data\n",

    "Preference tuning is a powerful tool that can optimize LLMs towards complex preferences that can not easily captured through supervised fine-tuning. However, manually annotating preferences between model outputs using human raters can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. Instead, synthetic preference data can be generated by scoring responses with large foundation models, allowing for much cheaper and scalable data collection!\n",

      "By . Ashley Collman . PUBLISHED: . 08:43 EST, 12 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:20 EST, 12 July 2013 . Privileges reinstated: Dr Shakil Khan Afridi was allowed to see family last Wednesday after a 10-month ban on visitors following an interview he gave Fox News . The doctor who helped the CIA locate Osama Bin Laden is finally getting visits from his family at the Pakistani prison where he is being jailed. Dr Shakil Khan Afridi was convicted to 33 years in prison in May 2012 for 'acting against the state.' When the CIA was trying to confirm Bin Laden's presence in the Abbottabad compound, they sent Dr Afridi in under the auspices of giving out hepatitis B vaccinations. Investigators hoped the vaccinations would provide DNA evidence to confirm who was in the compound. While . Afridi was unsuccessful with the vaccinations, he was able to provide . enough details for the CIA to go through with their raid. When . the Pakistani government found out that one of their own was being used . as a spy for the U.S. agency, he was arrested and tried for treason. In . a surprising move, the Pakistanis tried him under a British-era . regulation that didn't carry the death sentence, unlike the standard . treason charge. He was convicted and has been serving his sentence at Central Prison in Peshawar. When he spoke to Fox News last year about his treatment by the Pakistanis, he was banned from all meetings. Imprisoned: Afridi is serving his 33-year sentence at Central Prison in Peshawar . Last month, that ban was lifted after 10 months. On Wednesday, Afridi was finally able to meet with his wife, Imrana Ghafur, and their three children, between the ages 10 and 15, according to Fox News. Other . sources told Fox that privileges such as being able to receive . food and clothing from family members have been reinstated for Afridi. Afridi's . brother, Jamil Afiridi has since tried to visit the prison but was told . that only the wife and children were on the list of approved visitors. Limited meetings: Afridi's brother Jamil attempted to visit him at the prison, but was turned away . Not even his lawyers are allowed to meet with their client. 'We . are not aware they met, and how did authorities get in touch with them . (the family) without notifying us?' one of Afridi's lawyers asked. But they remain optimistic that the doctor will have his sentence cut short. 'I . think things are changing and moving rapidly,' said the lawyer. 'I feel . that something good will happen soon and freedom (for Afridi) will be . achieved' Afridi's next hearing is on July 18. The U.S. has been pushing hard for Afridi's release ever since he was imprisoned. After Afridi's help with the raid, CIA agents told him that he should seek shelter in Afghanistan with his family. Pivotal: Dr Afridi gained important details from his visit to the compound where Bin Laden was hiding out - details that helped the CIA with their raid . Afridi . didn't want to risk traveling through the dangerous Pashtun tribal . region on the Pakistan -Afghanistan border, so he decided to stay in his . home country. He . didn't know that Bin Laden was in the facility he investigated, so he . didn't think he was at risk of angering the Pakistani government. Since his imprisonment several American officials have called for his release. 'The . doctor was never asked to spy on Pakistan,' a senior American official . told the New York Times. 'He was asked only to help locate Al Qaeda . terrorists, who threaten Pakistan and the U.S. He helped save Pakistani . and American lives.' Former . Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also called for Afridi's release. Last . September, Senator Rand Paul propositioned cutting off aid for Pakistan . if the doctor was not released to the U.S.\n",

      "(CNN) -- The wife of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn said she is closing down her popular French blog. Anne Sinclair, who has been writing about life in the United States on her blog, \"Two or Three Things Seen in America\" since 2008, wrote Monday: \"You understand the circumstances which force me to temporarily suspend this blog.\" She closed by saying, \"See you soon.\" Strauss-Kahn, who is awaiting a trial on sexual assault charges, was released on bail from the Rikers Island jail Friday. He is accused of trying to rape a maid this month in his suite at the Sofitel hotel in New York. He will stay with his wife. Strauss-Kahn faces two counts of criminal sexual act; two counts of sexual abuse; and one count each of attempt to commit rape, unlawful imprisonment and forcible touching. In the charge of criminal sexual act in the first degree, Strauss-Kahn is accused of having \"engaged in oral sexual conduct with an individual ... by forcible compulsion,\" an indictment states. There appears to be growing popular sympathy for Sinclair, a former television broadcaster described by some as the \"Barbara Walters\" of France. \"She is very courageous,\" said Jack Lang, one of the elders of France's Socialist Party, as well as a friend and neighbor of Strauss-Kahn. In her message to her blog readers, Sinclair said, \"You have sent me very many messages. I cannot answer each one but know that they touched and helped me.\" CNN's Marilia Brocchetto contributed to this report.\n",

      "The home towns of the terrorists responsible for last week's attacks in France do not want to bury the gunmen amid fears their graves will become shrines for Islamic extremists. Town officials have admitted they want to 'avoid' burying Said and Cherif Kouachi, behind the massacre at Charlie Hebdo, and Amedy Coulibaly, shot dead after a siege at a Jewish deli in Paris. Under French law, the burials must take place either in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. Scroll down for video . Concerns are growing over where the terrorists responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre will be buried, with towns fearing the graves of Cherif (left) and Said Kouachi (right) could become Islamic extremist shrines . The hometown of Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four in the kosher deli in eastern Paris before being killed in a hail of police gunfire, isn't keen to bury the terrorist . The Kouachi brothers were shot dead by the police as they charged out of a printworks in Dammartin-en-Goele, north east of Paris, meaning they could be buried nearby. Their father died when they were young and they were taken into care, meaning they have no immediate family who wish to organise a possible funeral and burial elsewhere. A spokesman for Dammartin-en-Goele's local council told The Times: 'If we have to bury them here, we will obey the law, but we'd rather avoid it.' Chérif Kouachi lived in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris, and his brother lived in  Reims, northeastern France. Both town councils refused to comment but it is understood that they want to avoid the terrorists being buried in their regions. Coulibaly died in a hail of police gunfire in Paris after murdering four of his hostages at the kosher supermarket. Funerals were held today for some of those killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack, including police officer Franck Brinsolaro . Officers applauded when the coffin of Brinsolaro was carried out of a church draped in the French flag . Hundreds gathered outside the town hall of Montreuil, Paris, for the funeral of Charlie Hebdo cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac . He lived in Fontenay-aux-Roses, a Paris suburb. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.' Meanwhile funerals are being held for staff killed in the attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo amid continued demand for its first edition since the massacre killed 12 people. Hundreds gathered for the ceremonies for Franck Brinsolaro, the killed police officer whose job it was to guard Charlie Hebdo editor and cartoonist Stéphane 'Charb' Charbonnier. Policemen broke into applause as the coffin of Mr Brinsolaro was carried into a church in the town of Bernay this morning. Otter funerals to take place were those of cartoonist Bernard 'Tignous' Verlhac and psychoanalyst and Charlie Hebdo columnist Elsa Cayat.\n",

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam are determined to keep the education of their 11-year-old son 'out of politics' Nick Clegg yesterday defended the possibility he may send his children to private schools as it emerged he and his wife Miriam have not even visited their local state school. He said the education of his 11-year-old son Antonio, who starts secondary school this year, should not be used as 'a political football' and that the couple would do 'what's best' for their children although he was braced for criticism. Last week the Liberal Democrat leader told listeners to his radio show he would send his son to a private school if he failed to find a place in a good comprehensive, saying he would use the state system 'if it works out', but that there is 'huge competition' for places in London. But Mr Clegg, who attended Westminster public school, has apparently not looked around nearby Ark Putney academy in south-west London, it was revealed yesterday by its headmaster Mark Phillips. Mr Phillips who has turned the school around since he was hired three years ago, said the school which was once in special measures but is now lauded by the Government for its improvements, could provide an 'exceptional' education for any child and that there was no need to pay fees for schooling. Unless the Cleggs had visited 'under cover' he had not seen them, he said.'I am always very clear that all parents living locally are welcome to choose our school and it is important that every parent comes with their child and takes an objective look to see whether what we offer will meet the needs of their child', he said. 'It wouldn't claim to be the answer to every child and every parent. But I hope that if a parent does come, and sees an environment their child will thrive in, they will pick us...I am confident they will do exceptionally well. I don't believe you have to pay for it.' Mr Clegg told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he and his wife will do whatever is in the interests of their son . If he chooses to educate his children . privately, Mr Clegg is likely to be accused of hypocrisy after using a . speech last year to attack 'the great rift in our education system' caused by many of the best schools being fee-paying and said it had a . 'corrosive' effect on society and the economy. In . an interview on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'I accept that it's a . dilemma for anyone in public life, particularly in politics, how do you . balance that with the fact Miriam and I have small children, and the . approach Miriam and I took right from the outset was to keep our . children completely out of politics.

The deadline for applying for entry to Ark Putney for 2013-14 was last October. The school is part of the Ark academy chain, set up in 2004, whose chairman is Paul Marshall, one of the Liberal Democrats' biggest donors. Last year 62 per cent of pupils gained at least five good GCSEs, prompting schools minister Nick Gibb to write to Mr Phillips to congratulate him on the 'excellent results' saying the school was in the top 100 best-performing, based on sustained improvements every year since 2008.

      "Gary Lyon has been jailed for stealing from his own mother and conning people into giving him money by telling them his daughter was lying in hospital and he needed cash to get to see her . A conman who duped strangers into giving him money by pretending his 11-year-old daughter had cancer has been jailed for 18 months. Gary Lyon, 47, told generous well-wishers that his child was lying, gravely ill, in hospital in Manchester 'with tubes coming out of her arms.' In fact, a daughter of Lyon, who is now 15, had contracted leukaemia in 2009 when she was younger but had made a full recovery. Lyon scammed victims by falsely claiming he had run out of petrol on the way to see her in hospital. On one occasion he targeted an 80-year-old woman after he told her his bank card had snapped and he needed £20 to buy fuel. Graham Robinson, prosecuting, said: 'The first complainant... was was approached by the defendant who used a ruse he was to repeat many times, saying his daughter was in The Christie Hospital and he had run out of petrol.' The father of two from Sharston, near Wythenshawe, Manchester claimed he would repay the cash but gave a false name and telephone number. On another occasion, he was given £10 by a stranger after saying he needed to pick his daughter up from hospital following surgery to treat leukaemia. He even told the victim: 'Mate, that's really not enough. £20 will see me through.' In yet another incident, Lyon showed a tattoo of his daughter's name to a man and after getting £20 said: 'I swear on my daughter's life I will pay you back.' Lyon told a fourth victim who gave him £40: 'You are the kindest man I ever met.' Manchester Crown Court heard that in addition to the frauds, jobless Lyon, who has 42 previous convictions, repeatedly stole from his 70-year-old disabled mother, Anna. Whilst she was on holiday in America, Lyon stole her bank card and began plundering her funds in order to fund his £50-a-day crack cocaine habit. The court heard Lyon stole the bank card and used a mobility scooter before withdrawing £1,500 on 23 occasions using a telephone banking service. She returned from her holiday to find her son had taken £6,000 worth of jewellery which was later retrieved from a pawnbrokers. One of Lyon's victims admitted he was suspicious of Lyon's sob story and even told him: 'If you are lying, you will go to hell.' Lyon told  one of his victims that his daughter was in Manchester's Christie Hospital 'with tubes in her arms' He later told police: 'I didn't really believe a word but thought it's better to be conned than be wrong and this is someone genuinely in that situation.' Lyon pleaded guilty to four thefts, eight counts of fraud and one count of taking a vehicle without the owner's consent. In mitigation, defence counsel Tom McKail said: 'The offences committed by this defendant against the public are deplorable and he is disgusted and embarrassed by his behaviour. 'He has also taken advantage of a previously supporting and loving family and apologises to all parties who have been affected by his behaviour and selfish ways. 'At the end of 2012 the defendant's daughter did indeed suffer from leukaemia but recovered, but while given the all clear his relationship with his then-partner, the mother of his two daughters deteriorated. As a by-product he fell back into a way of life he believed he had left behind.' Sentencing Lyon, judge Miss Recorder Fiona Barry said: 'You repeatedly used your daughter's previous ill health to illicit sympathy and generosity to fund your drug addiction. Some victims were vulnerable and another was scared. It is not possible to suspend this sentence.'\n"
