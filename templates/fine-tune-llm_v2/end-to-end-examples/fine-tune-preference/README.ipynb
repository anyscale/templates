    "# Preference Tuning for Summarization using Synthetic Data\n",

    "Preference tuning is a powerful tool that can optimize LLMs towards complex preferences that cannot be easily captured through supervised fine-tuning. However, manually annotating preferences between model outputs using human raters can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. Instead, synthetic preference data can be generated by scoring responses with large foundation models, allowing for much cheaper and scalable data collection!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll go through an end-to-end example for preference tuning of an open-source language model with synthetic data, covering scalable methodologies for data preprocessing, fine-tuning and evaluation, using Ray. We will focus on the task of summarization for the [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) dataset. \n",
