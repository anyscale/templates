    "# Preference Tuning for Summarization using Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏱️ Time to complete**: \\<TODO\\>\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference tuning is a powerful tool that can optimize LLMs towards complex preferences that can not easily captured through supervised fine-tuning. However, manually annotating preferences between model outputs using human raters can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. Instead, synthetic preference data can be generated by scoring responses with large foundation models, allowing for much cheaper and scalable data collection!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll go through an end-to-end example for preference tuning of an open-source language model with synthetic data, covering data preprocessing, fine-tuning and evaluation. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will focus on the task of summarization for the [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) dataset. "

    "2. [DPO Finetuning](#step-2-fine-tuning): This section will cover how you can fine-tune an open source model on the preference data on the Anyscale platform.\n",
    "3. [Evaluation](#step-3-evaluation): The section will lay down a blue-print for evaluation and compare performance to that of closed source models like OpenAI's GPT-4.\n",
    "4. [Iterative-DPO](#step-4-iterative): An optional step to further boost performance with iterative preference-tuning. "

    "Now, we need to get preference data for pairs of summaries generated from the same article. Traditionally, this would involve generating summaries using the base model you wish to fine-tune and asking human annotators to provide a rating for each sample. In this example, we will employ a _synthetic_ summary scoring method using an LLM as a judge. We score the correctness of a summary using the following metrics:\n",

    "2. Otherwise, we select the response that leads to more correctly answered multiple choice questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the training data, we will generate 10 summaries from each article using the model we wish to fine-tune. Then, we will randomly sample pairs of summaries and use our preference function to annotate the preference between them.\n",
