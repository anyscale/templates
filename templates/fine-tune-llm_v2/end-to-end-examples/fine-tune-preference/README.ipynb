    "# Preference Tuning for Summarization using Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏱️ Time to complete**: 10 hours+\n",
    "\n",
    "Alignment of LLMs has traditionally been broken down into two post-training stages: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference tuning (aka RLHF). SFT requires high quality data collection where each data sample illustrates behavior which we would like the LLM to imitate exactly. While for some tasks like SQL generation and math reasoning, it is feasible to collect the ground truth data, this approach does not always scale easily to align for subjective use cases (ex. chat, summarization, etc.). \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, preference tuning only requires information about whether a given response is preferred to another response. Each data sample consists of a chosen and rejected completion for a given prompt, such that the chosen completion is preferred over the rejected completion. Preference tuning is thus a powerful tool that can optimize LLMs towards complex preferences that cannot be easily captured through supervised fine-tuning. However, manually annotating preferences between model outputs using human raters can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. Instead, synthetic preference data can be generated by scoring responses with large foundation models, allowing for much cheaper and scalable data collection!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll go through an end-to-end example for preference tuning of an open-source language model with synthetic data, covering scalable methodologies for data preprocessing, fine-tuning and evaluation, using Ray. We will focus on the task of summarization for the [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) dataset. \n",

    "Consider the example article above. Our goal is to train a model to summarize it accurately, with a preference for short summaries, making sure we also preserve important details. In this guide, we will employ a _synthetic_ summary scoring method using another LLM as a judge. We score the correctness of a summary using the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary Scoring Metrics**\n",
    "1. Multiple choice Q&A accuracy:\n",
    "    - Given the original text, we use an LLM judge to generate 5 multiple choice questions about the text.\n",
    "    - We then ask the LLM judge to answer the questions using only the summary, and record the number of questions correctly answered.\n",
    "2. Word count: We simply count the number of words in the summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to construct a simple preference function between two summaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Preference Function**\n",
    "1. If both summary responses attain more than 3/5 multiple choice questions correct, we will prefer the shorter response. We do not care about Q&A accuracy beyond 3 correct answers, since the summary should not contain all information from the text.\n",
    "2. Otherwise, we select the response that leads to more correctly answered multiple choice questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider a subset of 21,000 articles in this example. To generate the preference pairs, we will generate 10 summaries from each article using the model we wish to fine-tune. Then, we will randomly sample pairs of summaries and use our preference function to annotate the preference between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will use `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` as the base model to fine-tune and `Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` as a judge. Note that mistral-instruct is already instruction tuned, so that given a prompt to do summarization it might do a good job, but it may not be aligned with how we want the summarization to look like. We can use preference data to further align the instruct variant towards our specific needs.\n",

    "- We use a combination of Q&A scoring + word length to indicate like/dislike (our preference function) given a pair of summaries.\n",
    "- Our ultimate goal is to generate (chosen, rejected) pairs to train our reference model and evaluate it based on this criteria.\n",
    "- We use another LLM (judge model) to generate said questions for each article. This model is also used in our scoring system. (To see how many questions can be answered from a summary)\n",
    "- To generate training data, we first sample candidate summaries from the reference model for each article. We then obtain scores for each summary from the judge. Using the scores, we select pairs of summaries and mark our like/dislike to form (chosen, rejected) pairs for the actual training. \n"

You can explicitly set the compute configuration for the job with a set number of worker nodes to avoid this (but this might involve more wait times).\n",
