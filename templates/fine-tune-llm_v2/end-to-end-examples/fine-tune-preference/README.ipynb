    "# Preference Tuning for Summarization using Synthetic Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏱️ Time to complete**: 10 hours\n",
    "\n",
    "Preference tuning is a powerful tool that can optimize LLMs towards complex preferences that cannot be easily captured through supervised fine-tuning. However, manually annotating preferences between model outputs using human raters can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. Instead, synthetic preference data can be generated by scoring responses with large foundation models, allowing for much cheaper and scalable data collection!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we'll go through an end-to-end example for preference tuning of an open-source language model with synthetic data, covering scalable methodologies for data preprocessing, fine-tuning and evaluation, using Ray. We will focus on the task of summarization for the [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) dataset. \n",

      "recently, they revealed the secret behind how this crucial demographic decides\n",

      "every Democrat to President Barack Obama, the women didn't see the unpopular\n",
      "president as a campaign issue, even if they think he is doing a bad job. What\n",
      "was most striking in the group, however, was how distant the Senate races in\n",

      "in Louisiana's Senate race, between Democrat Mary Landrieu, Republican Bill\n",

      "and mother of one. \"Unless you are out there serving that child at school, or\n",
