# Preference Tuning for Summarization using Synthetic Data

**‚è±Ô∏è Time to complete**: 10 hours

Alignment of LLMs has traditionally been broken down into two post-training stages: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference tuning (aka RLHF). SFT requires high quality data collection where each data sample illustrates behavior which we would like the LLM to imitate exactly. While for some tasks like SQL generation and math reasoning, it is feasible to collect the ground truth data, this approach does not always scale easily to align for subjective use cases (ex. chat, summarization, etc.). 

On the other hand, preference tuning only requires information about whether a given response is preferred to another response. Each data sample consists of a chosen and rejected completion for a given prompt, such that the chosen completion is preferred over the rejected completion. Preference tuning is thus a powerful tool that can optimize LLMs towards complex preferences that cannot be easily captured through supervised fine-tuning. However, manually annotating preferences between model outputs using human raters can be extremely time-consuming and expensive. Instead, synthetic preference data can be generated by scoring responses with large foundation models, allowing for much cheaper and scalable data collection!

Here we'll go through an end-to-end example for preference tuning of an open-source language model with synthetic data, covering scalable methodologies for data preprocessing, fine-tuning and evaluation, using Ray. We will focus on the task of summarization for the [CNN/DailyMail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) dataset.

Consider the example article above. Our goal is to train a model to summarize it accurately, with a preference for short summaries, making sure we also preserve important details. In this guide, we will employ a _synthetic_ summary scoring method using another LLM as a judge. We score the correctness of a summary using the following metrics:

**Summary Scoring Metrics**
1. Multiple choice Q&A accuracy:
    - Given the original text, we use an LLM judge to generate 5 multiple choice questions about the text.
    - We then ask the LLM judge to answer the questions using only the summary, and record the number of questions correctly answered.
2. Word count: We simply count the number of words in the summary.

This allows us to construct a simple preference function between two summaries:

**Preference Function**
1. If both summary responses attain more than 3/5 multiple choice questions correct, we will prefer the shorter response. We do not care about Q&A accuracy beyond 3 correct answers, since the summary should not contain all information from the text.
2. Otherwise, we select the response that leads to more correctly answered multiple choice questions.

We consider a subset of 21,000 articles in this example. To generate the preference pairs, we will generate 10 summaries from each article using the model we wish to fine-tune. Then, we will randomly sample pairs of summaries and use our preference function to annotate the preference between them.

For this example, we will use `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` as the base model to fine-tune and `Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct` as a judge. Note that mistral-instruct is already instruction tuned, so that given a prompt to do summarization it might do a good job, but it may not be aligned with how we want the summarization to look like. We can use preference data to further align the instruct variant towards our specific needs.

We've provided a helpful visualization here:

</p>

Combining all this together, our data pre-processing pipeline is going to look as follows: 

![preprocessing](./assets/preprocessing.png?1)

üí° INSIGHT: 
Our synthetic preference data collection looks pretty involved at first glance. The key ideas in plain English are as follows:
- We use a combination of Q&A scoring + word length to indicate like/dislike (our preference function) given a pair of summaries.
- Our ultimate goal is to generate (chosen, rejected) pairs to train our reference model and evaluate it based on this criteria.
- We use another LLM (judge model) to generate said questions for each article. This model is also used in our scoring system. (To see how many questions can be answered from a summary)
- To generate training data, we first sample candidate summaries from the reference model for each article. We then obtain scores for each summary from the judge. Using the scores, we select pairs of summaries and mark our like/dislike to form (chosen, rejected) pairs for the actual training. 


### Part (a): Generate Multiple Choice Questions from Articles

First, we will generate the multiple choice questions and answers for each article using `Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct` (or `70B` if A100/H100s are available). Leveraging vLLM and Ray, we can very easily scale this generation process across multiple GPUs.

>  **_NOTE:_**  We provide two sets of configs: One with an 8B parameter model as the judge, and another with the 70B model. Using the 8B model is recommended, since we make use of highly available A10Gs. For good performance, and to replicate the results in our blog, you should use the 70B judge model which uses A100s (but these are harder to obtain on-demand)

The following command will run the [src/scripts/generate_questions.py](./src/scripts/generate_questions.py) script, which generates the questions and answers and saves them in `.parquet` files.


üí° INSIGHT:  
We are running this script as an anyscale job. The resources required by each step are requested at runtime and provisioned by Anyscale's autoscaler based on availability and quotas. You are free to change the [qa_generation](./configs/qa_generation) config in any way. The important parameters regarding resources are `accelerator_type`, `num_gpus_per_instance`, and `concurrency`. This script will generate 5 multiple choice question and answer pairs per article for 21k examples. According to the [llama_8b](./configs/qa_generation/llama_8b.yaml) config we are requesting 3 replicas of 4xA10G machines processing a batch-size of 128 examples each which saturates the GPUs all the way through.

This step will take ~75 min for 8B running on A10s and ~?? for 70B running on A100s.

```bash
anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/8b_judge/generate_questions_job.yaml
# Optional: use the 70b model for better performance (runs on A100s)
# anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/70b_judge/generate_questions_job.yaml
```

> **NOTE**: We recommend that you execute all the commands in this notebook in a terminal. Make sure you `cd` into the directory of this notebook (and the `src` files) before executing the commands. 

At the end of the job, you should see the remote path to the folder with Q&A in the logs.

    TEXT:
    From balloon-popping lasers to Wolverine-style claws, there are numerous concept
    and protoype weapons designed by wannabe superhero inventors. But, a magician
    has not only created a wristband that turns the wearer into Pyro from the Marvel
    comics, he is selling it for $174 (¬£111) online. Named after the comic book
    mutant, the Pyro band features four chambers that fires four fireballs, and it
    can be controlled from the wrist or remotely. Scroll down for video . Pyro
    (pictured) was designed by New Hampshire magician Adam Wilber. It features four
    separate chambers for four multiple shots and can be controlled either from the
    wrist or remotely . Its inventor, Adam Wilber explained: ‚ÄòFire. Since the dawn
    of time it has been the reward at the end of man's quest. Both creator and
    destroyer, it has historically been the element hardest to control. ‚ÄòUntil now.
    Your quest is over. The power of fire in the palm of your hand. That's the power
    of Pyro.' It is available from the Ellusionist site, and ships internationally.
    The band resembles a watch and can be concealed under a sleeve. Pressing a
    button on the device shoots the fireballs, or a remote control can be used to
    fire them from a distance of up to 30ft (nine metres) away. The band resembles a
    watch and can be concealed under a sleeve (pictured left).¬†It uses so-called
    Flash Cotton, or Flash Paper that fits inside the barrels. A heater coil then
    ignites the material when the button is pressed, forcing the flame to fire from
    the chambers . The device is named after Marvel comic book character Pyro,
    played by Adam Burton in the X-Men franchise (pictured). In the series, Pyro is
    a so-called Class 4 mutant that can create and control fire . If smartwatches
    from the likes of Apple and Motorola don't appeal to you, a German inventor has
    built a powerful alternative. Dubbed Bond Inspired LaserWatch, the timepiece was
    designed at home by a hobbyist using a metal case, screws, and a built-in laser
    pointer. The designer recently demonstrated the power of the laser by popping
    balloons and lighting matches from around 3ft (one metre) away. It is the
    brainchild of Wuppertal-based Patrick Priebe. It uses so-called Flash Cotton, or
    Flash Paper that fits inside the barrels. A heater coil then ignites the
    material when the button is pressed, forcing the flame to fire from the
    chambers. The pack contains enough of this material for up to 50 uses. Refills
    then start at $8 (¬£4). Flash material is used by magicians to create fast
    burning flames for tricks. Mr Wilber describes Pryo as a ‚Äòbadass professional
    device‚Äô, and as a result only over 18s are allowed to purchase or use the fire
    shooter. The site ships internationally, but a disclaimer stresses that the
    device ‚Äòcontains dangerous elements‚Äô that are governed by the laws of the
    country in which is it bought. Buyers have to agree to the terms and conditions,
    and watch an instructional safety video by Adam Wilber, before buying the
    device. It is recommended, and has been built for, magicians. ‚ÄòIn the lead up to
    release we sent a number of Pyro units out to some of the most creative up-and-
    comers in the industry to put the unit through its paces,‚Äô explained
    Ellusionist. ‚ÄòEvery single person that received Pyrocalled us up and raved about
    it. Pyro has ignited an excitement within them. Pressing a button on the device
    shoots the fireballs, or a remote control (pictured) can be used from up to 30ft
    (nine metres) away. It costs $174 (¬£111) and ships internationally. ¬†Buyers have
    to agree to the terms and conditions, and watch a safety video before buying. It

    TEXT:
    Washington (CNN) -- When two focus groups met earlier this week -- conducted
    using "Walmart moms" or women ages 29-54 who've shopped at the big-box retailer
    recently, they revealed the secret behind how this crucial demographic decides
    whom they vote for this year: Google. "You Google it," said participants from
    North Carolina when asked about their voting decision process. "Probably the
    night before," said another North Carolina woman, on when she looks up
    information on candidates. The women were part of two, ten-person groups in
    North Carolina and Louisiana on Monday night that were underwritten by Walmart.
    In both states, female Democratic Senators are running in tight reelection
    races, meaning that the women in the focus groups represent an essential
    category of voters Democrats need to keep those seats and hold on to control of
    the Senate. The racially, ethnically and educationally diverse group of mothers
    expressed concern about the future throughout most of the three-hours of focus
    grouping. Many were concerned about Ebola and less so about ISIS. They can
    recall the negative ads in their respective Senate races, but on the whole,
    don't know the candidates well. And even though Republicans have tried to tie
    every Democrat to President Barack Obama, the women didn't see the unpopular
    president as a campaign issue, even if they think he is doing a bad job. What
    was most striking in the group, however, was how distant the Senate races in
    each state felt to the women. According to the Center for Responsive Politics,
    in Louisiana's Senate race, between Democrat Mary Landrieu, Republican Bill
    Cassidy and independent Rob Maness, almost $40 million has been spent. Upwards
    of $80 million has been spent in the race between Thom Tillis and Kay Hagan in
    North Carolina. All that money, though, has bought very little with these women.
    "Nothing is going to change," said Lauren, a 44-year old North Carolinian.
    Politicians "stand where they stand. Nothing is going to change the next two
    weeks. It is going to be like you are cramming for a test." Their interest
    doesn't mean they aren't concerned, however. The Walmart moms of this particular
    focus group say they are worried about the future, anxious about their children
    and feel like politicians in Washington don't understand their daily struggle.
    We are "out of site, out of mind," said Jennifer, a 38-year old cafeteria worker
    and mother of one. "Unless you are out there serving that child at school, or
    helping that student with just learning how to be nice with one another... or
    you are getting up at 4:30 in the morning so you can beat the rush hour and get
    to work on time." After a slight pause, she added. "They don't [understand],
    they can't." When asked what one message they would communicate to leaders in
    Washington, the women struck a similar tune: My representatives in Washington
    have lost touch with their roots and don't understand my struggle. "I wish you
    could have been in my shoes, and seen [the] struggle of a single parent," said
    Theodosia, a 40-year old women who voted for Obama in 2012. "I remember where I
    came from," said Andrea, a 32-year old mother of three who voted for Romney. "I
    work hard for everything I have, tangible and intangible," said Jennifer. Her
    comment resonated with the women, they nodded as she said it. In North Carolina,
    most of the mothers recalled very little about Hagan or Tillis. Hagan, they
    said, was trying to portray Tillis as unstable, while Tillis was trying to cast
    Hagan as another vote for Obama, the women said. But other than that, not much
    stuck. In Louisiana, where there was slightly more definition, the women
    struggled to name all three candidates. The women could remember Landrieu's
    positive ad -- including a "cute" one with her father -- and recalled attacks
    that "she doesn't even live here any more." (Earlier this year, questions about
    Landrieu's residency were raised by a story in the Washington Post that said the
    senator doesn't own her own house in Louisiana and, instead, lives at her home
    on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. The senator has vehemently denied the
    charge.) "If she doesn't live here, how is she supposed to know what the true
    problems are," said one woman. "How is she supposed to know?" But that is really
    where the recollections ended. What did universally stick, however, was that all
    the campaigning has been negative. "All I get from all of those [ads] is don't
    vote for that person, because they are a bad person, vote for me," said one
    woman in North Carolina. When asked what the Landrieu campaign wanted voters to
    think about Cassidy, one woman in New Orleans put it this way: "That he is the
    devil." The reason they feel disconnected, according to women in both North
    Carolina and Louisiana, is that the people who represent them in Washington are
    of little concern to them because those politicians could never fathom their
    daily struggle. The women told stories about struggling to pay for their
    children's education, their health care and their groceries. They talked about
    dealing with their spouse's job loss or trying to make ends meet with little.
    They also became animated when talking about the upcoming holidays and how they
    plan to save money to provide all they can or their kids. And when reflecting on
    all of this, the women said the same thing: The politicians asking for my vote
    don't get all of this. "Moms say politicians 'don't get it' and need to 'walk in
    my shoes,'" read a memo about the conversation from Neil Newhouse and Margie
    Omero, two pollsters who helped organize the group. "This is a perennial Walmart
    mom complaint that frankly only gets louder with each conversation." This
    sentiment was encapsulated by Jennifer, the woman from North Carolina who said
    she struggled for everything she has. "Once they go home to the farm, it isn't a
    dirty farm," she said of when lawmakers leave North Carolina and go to
    Washington. When they come home, she said, their farm "is a clean farm... with a
    tractor that would make John Deere faint."

    TEXT:
    (CNN) -- Top British officials paid a visit Saturday to leaders of Libya's
    opposition government, the beneficiary of the first NATO helicopter attacks on
    ruler Moammar Gadhafi' military vehicles, equipment and forces. Foreign
    Secretary William Hague and International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell
    traveled to Benghazi, where they reiterated support for the Transitional
    National Council. According to a statement, Mitchell announced new support for
    the clearing of mines in besieged cities, including Misrata. He and Hague
    visited a Benghazi hospital treating those wounded in the conflict. The visit,
    which included a discussion of the country's possible future, followed
    helicopter attacks by British and French forces on the regime's military. "This
    successful engagement demonstrates the unique capabilities brought to bear by
    attack helicopters," said Lt. Gen. Charles Bouchard, who commands NATO's Libya
    operation. "We will continue to use these assets whenever and wherever needed,
    using the same precision as we do in all of our missions." British forces,
    flying from the HMS Ocean, used Apache helicopters for the overnight strikes,
    according to the Ministry of Defence. French helicopters took off from the
    assault ship Tonnerre, the ministry said in a statement. The Apaches struck a
    regime radar installation and a military checkpoint, both located around Brega,
    a key oil town in the east, British officials said. Hellfire missiles and 30mm
    cannon were used to destroy the targets, they said. Royal Air Force ground
    attack aircraft destroyed another military installation, while a separate
    mission hammered two ammunition bunkers in central Libya, according to the
    statement. A French military spokesman said 20 targets, including vehicles, were
    destroyed. Several helicopters responded to small-arms fire from the ground, but
    none were hit, he said. "The use of attack helicopters provides the NATO
    operation with additional flexibility to track and engage pro-Gadhafi forces who
    deliberately target civilians and attempt to hide in populated areas," NATO said
    in a statement. Meanwhile, a string of explosions -- at least 10 -- rocked the
    Libyan capital of Tripoli early Saturday evening, CNN journalists reported. Six
    more explosions were heard early Sunday. One of the explosions struck an old
    military station about 25 kilometers (16 miles) south of the city, a government
    official said. There also was fighting in the western city of Zintan. According
    to Mamdouh Dardair, a rebel fighter, portions of the town were hit by a large
    number of rockets fired by Gadhafi forces. The rockets damaged infrastructure,
    but there were no immediate reports of injuries. CNN could not confirm the
    account. On Friday, fighting continued in the western town of Yefren, where
    NATO-allied aircraft destroyed government tanks and personnel carriers,
    officials said. NATO warplanes belonging to the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force
    fired Paveway guided bombs and destroyed two main battle tanks and two armored
    personnel carriers belonging to Libya's military, said Maj. Gen. John Lorimer,
    strategic communication officer for the chief of the defense staff. The
    airstrikes occurred Thursday, he said. NATO reported that government forces were
    continuing "to attack the peoples of the western highlands," Lorimer said.
    Meanwhile, rebels claimed to liberate Yefren and the nearby town of Kikla, both
    of which are about 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of their stronghold in Zintan,
    one rebel fighter said. Talhat al-Jiwayli, a rebel on the front lines in Zintan,
    also said that anti-Gadhafi forces were surrounding the town of al-Rayyana, more
    than seven miles northeast of Zintan. A resolution approved by the U.N. Security
    Council in March authorized member states "to take all necessary measures to
    protect civilians under threat of attack in the country, including Benghazi,
    while excluding a foreign occupation force of any form on any part of Libyan
    territory." . CNN's Kareem Khadder and Michael Martinez contributed to this
    report.

### Part (b): Generate Summaries + Scores

Next, we will generate 10 summaries for each article in the training set and score them with our Q&A judging setup. 

The following command will run the [generate_summaries_and_scores.py](src/scripts/generate_summaries_and_scores.py) script, which takes in the folder with generated questions + articles and stores the results to a new folder of `.parquet` files. This script will use the model under training to produce 10 summaries per each example on all of the input data examples. Followed by each summarization, it will also perform summary accuracy measurement, asking the down-stream LLM to answer the questions generated earlier solely based on the summaries generated by the desired model. 

üîÑ REPLACE the S3 URI in [`configs/summary_generation/8b_judge/mistral_finetuned_eval.yaml`](configs/summary_generation/8b_judge/mistral_finetuned_eval.yaml) with the path to the folder with generated questions from the previous job


This job will take ~420 min for 8B on A10Gs and ~300 min for 70B on A100s given the default configurations.


```bash
anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/8b_judge/generate_summaries_train_job.yaml 
# Optional: use the 70b model for better performance (runs on A100s)
# anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/70b_judge/generate_summaries_train_job.yaml
```

üí° INSIGHT: If your job is unable to acquire the specified resources, it might indicate a lack of availability of GPUs. Try decreasing the `concurrency` argument for reference model or the judge. 

üîÑ REPLACE the below S3 URI with the link to the generated summaries from the job. You can optionally skip the previous with the example dataset below.


```python
# replace with the link to the generated summaries

    TEXT:
    (RollingStone.com) -- Jennifer Lawrence, the 20-year-old Oscar nominee for Best
    Actress, is sitting in a fancy Manhattan hotel sipping tea and feeling a little
    out of place. See, she grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, where her dad owned a
    construction company and her mom ran a summer camp. They had land and horses.
    She loved to fish. She was a total tomboy: field hockey, softball, basketball on
    an all-boys team. ("I was so dykey.") One of her nicknames was Nitro. She lives
    in Los Angeles now, but "little redneck things still come out." Like what? "I'm
    attracted to my brother. Stuff like that." 10 Best Movies of 2010 . At 14, she
    decided she wanted to be an actress and dragged her mom to New York for
    auditions. The people at Reese's Peanut Butter Cups told her she was the best
    they'd ever seen. Her mom told her they were lying. (Her mom didn't like showbiz
    much.) She auditioned for the role of Bella in "Twilight," which would have been
    perfect if Bella were a badass, but since she's a frightened waif, Lawrence
    ended up not getting the part. Which was for the best because the role she did
    get was for "Winter's Bone," in which she's fantastic: harrowing and tender as
    the 17-year-old daughter of an Ozarks meth-cooker who's fighting to take care of
    her little brother and sister. This article appears in the February 17, 2011
    issue of Rolling Stone. The issue is available now on newsstands and will appear
    in the online archive February 4. To prep for the part, Lawrence learned how to
    shoot a gun and field-dress squirrels. She already knew how to chop wood: "I
    went through a wood-chopping phase when I was nine or 10." She says she hasn't
    even bothered preparing an Oscar speech: "I have been practicing my losing face,
    though. Do you want to see it?" (For the record, it's a very good losing face.)
    Peter Travers Reviews 'Winter's Bone' Later this year comes "X-Men: First
    Class," where she'll play the mutant Mystique, blue-skinned and topless. ("Did I
    feel naked being naked?" she asks, so you don't have to. "Yeah. Totally.") But
    before that there's Jodie Foster's "The Beaver," premiering in May, in which she
    appears alongside a certifiable Mel Gibson. Which means she has some crazy Mel
    Gibson stories, right? She leans in close. "If I say, 'Off the record' -- that
    means you can't print it, right?' " Right. "OK. So, off the record ..." She's
    learning. Photos: 2011 Screen Actors Guild Award Winners . Copyright ¬© 2011

### Part (c): Generate Preference Tuning Data

The final step for getting our data ready! We'll now generate (chosen, rejected) summary pairs for each article based on the scores.

The following command will run the [generate_dpo_data.py](src/scripts/generate_dpo_data.py) script, which takes in the folder of summaries and outputs `.jsonl` files for training and validation.

üîÑ REPLACE the S3 URI in [`configs/training_data_generation/mistral_8b.yaml`](configs/training_data_generation/mistral_8b.yaml) with the path to the folder with generated summaries from the previous job

Run the following command in the terminal to generate DPO data:
```bash
python src/scripts/generate_dpo_data.py configs/training_data_generation/mistral_8b.yaml
```


```python
# Inspect the results
# Replace with the link to your validation file
validation_file = "s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization-example/dpo_training_data/valid.jsonl"

valid_ds = ray.data.read_json(validation_file)
example_rows = valid_ds.take(1)
```


```python
for row in example_rows:
    print_wrapped("PROMPT", row["chosen"][0]["content"])
    print_wrapped("CHOSEN RESPONSE", row["chosen"][1]["content"])
    print_wrapped("REJECTED RESPONSE", row["rejected"][1]["content"])

    PROMPT:
    Given the following text, create a very short summary that is at most 2
    sentences.  Text: By . Tamara Cohen, Political Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 18:32
    EST, 27 January 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:48 EST, 28 January 2013 . Deputy Prime
    Minister Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam are determined to keep the education of
    their 11-year-old son 'out of politics' Nick Clegg yesterday defended the
    possibility he may send his children to private schools as it emerged he and his
    wife Miriam have not even visited their local state school. He said the
    education of his 11-year-old son Antonio, who starts secondary school this year,
    should not be used as 'a political football' and that the couple would do
    'what's best' for their children although he was braced for criticism. Last week
    the Liberal Democrat leader told listeners to his radio show he would send his
    son to a private school if he failed to find a place in a good comprehensive,
    saying he would use the state system 'if it works out', but that there is 'huge
    competition' for places in London. But Mr Clegg, who attended Westminster public
    school, has apparently not looked around nearby Ark Putney academy in south-west
    London, it was revealed yesterday by its headmaster Mark Phillips. Mr Phillips
    who has turned the school around since he was hired three years ago, said the
    school which was once in special measures but is now lauded by the Government
    for its improvements, could provide an 'exceptional' education for any child and
    that there was no need to pay fees for schooling. Unless the Cleggs had visited
    'under cover' he had not seen them, he said.'I am always very clear that all
    parents living locally are welcome to choose our school and it is important that
    every parent comes with their child and takes an objective look to see whether
    what we offer will meet the needs of their child', he said. 'It wouldn't claim
    to be the answer to every child and every parent. But I hope that if a parent
    does come, and sees an environment their child will thrive in, they will pick
    us...I am confident they will do exceptionally well. I don't believe you have to
    pay for it.' Mr Clegg told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show yesterday that he and his
    wife will do whatever is in the interests of their son . If he chooses to
    educate his children . privately, Mr Clegg is likely to be accused of hypocrisy
    after using a . speech last year to attack 'the great rift in our education
    system' caused by many of the best schools being fee-paying and said it had a .
    'corrosive' effect on society and the economy. In . an interview on BBC1's
    Andrew Marr Show, he said: 'I accept that it's a . dilemma for anyone in public
    life, particularly in politics, how do you . balance that with the fact Miriam
    and I have small children, and the . approach Miriam and I took right from the
    outset was to keep our . children completely out of politics. 'We . never put
    them in front of the camera or to make them or their . education a political
    football. 'I totally accept that when we make a . decision that'll be subject to
    public commentary, criticism and so on, . but in the meantime we want to protect
    the privacy of an 11-year-old boy . and make the decision that we as parents
    think is best for our son.' The deadline for applying for entry to Ark Putney
    for 2013-14 was last October. The school is part of the Ark academy chain, set
    up in 2004, whose chairman is Paul Marshall, one of the Liberal Democrats'
    biggest donors. Last year 62 per cent of pupils gained at least five good GCSEs,
    prompting schools minister Nick Gibb to write to Mr Phillips to congratulate him
    on the 'excellent results' saying the school was in the top 100 best-performing,
    based on sustained improvements every year since 2008. However Michael Gove last
    year approved the sale of five acres of playing fields at the school including
    six tennis courts, a football pitch and a playground, to developers to fund
    refurbishments, after a ¬£40million revamp under the Building Schools for the
    Future programme was cancelled. Alumni of Ark Putney, which used to be Elliott
    School, include actor Pierce Brosnan, and 1960s England bowler Geoff Arnold.
    Former Welsh secretary Peter Hain sent his children to the school, which was the
    scene of the Christmas play in the film Love, Actually. David Cameron has said
    his children will attend state school, but George Osborne has been criticised
    for sending his to the fee-paying preparatory school in Kensington that he
    attended.
    
    CHOSEN RESPONSE:
    Nick Clegg and his wife Miriam are considering sending their 11-year-old son
    Antonio to a private school, despite their previous claims that they would use
    the state system. Clegg has not visited Ark Putney Academy, a nearby state
    school, but its headmaster, Mark Phillips, claims that the school could provide
    an 'exceptional' education for any child and that there is no need to pay fees
    for schooling. The deadline for applying to Ark Putney for 2013-14 was last
    October and the school is part of the Ark academy chain, set up in 2004, whose
    chairman is Paul Marshall, one of the Liberal Democrats' biggest donors.
    
    REJECTED RESPONSE:
    Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has defended the possibility of sending his
    children to private schools, stating that their education should not be used as
    a political football. He and his wife Miriam have not visited their local state
    school, but the headmaster of Ark Putney academy in London, where they were
    invited to attend, said the school could provide an "exceptional" education for
    any child and that parents should come to see it firsthand before making a
    decision.
    


# Step 2: Fine-tuning

Now that we have the pre-processed dataset, we are ready to fine-tune `Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1` using DPO. On Anyscale, we've created an easy-to-use interface to do preference-tuning using DPO. We leverage Ray to overlap reference model log-probability calculation with model training to improve GPU utilization. Most implementations compute log probabilities synchronously with model training,

![hf model](./assets/hf_dpo.png)

While our implementation using Ray is asynchronous:  


![assistant model](./assets/anyscale_dpo.png)

Further, our use of Ray Data also implies that the compute configuration for the reference model can be completely decoupled with the policy model. For example, reference model calculation can run on a different node (with configurable number of GPUs, etc) with zero code changes needed. 

> **NOTE** Make sure you've gove over the [user guides](https://docs.anyscale.com/category/fine-tuning-beta) for fine-tuning to understand the different configurations available

To get started with DPO training, we provide the config for DPO in [configs/mistral_dpo_summarization.yaml](configs/mistral_dpo_summarization.yaml) . 

 üîÑ REPLACE the training and validation file paths in the config with the output file paths in the previous step


```python
!cat configs/mistral_dpo_summarization.yaml
```

    model_id: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
    # Example summarization dataset with 10k examples for training with an average of 2.2k tokens per sample. 
    # Make sure to replace `train_path` and `valid_path` with the path to the files you generated
    train_path: s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization/train.jsonl

    no_gradient_checkpoint: False
    output_dir: /mnt/local_storage/
    # Deepspeed configuration, you can provide your own deepspeed setup

      modules_to_save: []
      bias: "none"
      fan_in_fan_out: false
      init_lora_weights: true


You can fine-tune the model now by submitting it as an Anyscale job: 

```bash
anyscale job submit configs/jobs/mistral_dpo_job.yaml
```

This should take about 8 hours. 

üí° INSIGHT: This fine-tuning job inherits the compute configuration of the current workspace - meaning the job runs on a CPU-only head node with auto-scaling enabled. Sometimes, the nodes you get with auto-scaling can be in-efficient for fine-tuning due to inter-node communication costs (Say you get 2 4xA10 nodes instead of 8xA10s due to availability). You can explicitly set the compute configuration for the job with a set number of worker nodes to avoid this. More on compute configurations here: https://docs.anyscale.com/configuration/compute-configuration 

# Step 3: Evaluation

Let's evaluate our trained model. Here we'll use two baselines: (1) the base model before finetuning (reference model in DPO) and (2) GPT-4o.

## Evaluation strategy

Our evaluation strategy involves the same Q&A scoring system as used while generating the preference data. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/eval.png?" alt="Evaluation" width=800>
</p>

We evaluate the baseline model and the trained DPO model on the test set. 

## Obtain summaries on the test set
First, we'll need to obtain the summaries (and scores) for both the models on the given test set. 

For the baseline model, you can simply run the below command:
```bash
anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/8b_judge/generate_summaries_eval_baseline_job.yaml
# Optional: use the 70b model for better performance (runs on A100s)
# anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/70b_judge/generate_summaries_eval_baseline_job.yaml 
```

This should take ~10 min for the 8B model and the 70B model.

For the fine-tuned DPO model, we provide a dummy config in [configs/summary_generation/8b_judge/mistral_finetuned_eval.yaml](configs/summary_generation/8b_judge/mistral_finetuned_eval.yaml). If you used the default training config provided, the model would be trained using LoRA and you should have a path to the LoRA weights. 


```python
!cat configs/summary_generation/8b_judge/mistral_finetuned_eval.yaml
```

    mode: eval
    input_folder: s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization-example/qa_generation/qa_annotations_full_test
    inference_type: offline
    model_inference_config:
      # Modify with s3 link to full param weights if you did full-param training
      model_id_or_path: mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1
    
      # Add path to lora weights here. If you did full param training, you can instead remove this field.
      adapter_id_or_path: s3://large-dl-models-mirror/finetuning_template/mistral_dpo_summarization_lora
    
      temperature: 0
      top_p: 0.95
      scaling_config:
        batch_size: 64
        concurrency: 2
        num_gpus_per_instance: 2
        accelerator_type: A10G
    num_generations: 1
    judge_inference_config:
      model_id_or_path: meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
      temperature: 0
      scaling_config:
        batch_size: 64
        concurrency: 3
        num_gpus_per_instance: 2
        accelerator_type: A10G
    num_mcq_questions: 5


 üîÑ REPLACE the `adapter_id_or_path` entry in the config with the path to your LoRA weights before proceeding (if you used the fine-tuning defaults). Alternatively, make sure to replace `model_id_or_path` entry (and remove the `adapter_id_or_path` entry) if you did full-param fine-tuning.

We are now ready to evaluate our fine-tuned model: 

> **NOTE**: Make sure to add your `WANDB_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the dependencies tab if you wish to track progress of your run on WandB.

```bash
anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/8b_judge/generate_summaries_eval_finetuned_job.yaml
# Optional: use the 70b model for better performance (runs on A100s)
# anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/70b_judge/generate_summaries_eval_finetuned_job.yaml
```

In the logs for the above jobs, you should see the final path to the output summaries for both the models. 

Optionally, you can also obtain the summaries and scores for the `gpt-4o` model from OpenAI. Simply run: 

```bash
anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/8b_judge/generate_summaries_eval_gpt_job.yaml
# Optional: use the 70b model for better performance (runs on A100s)
# anyscale job submit -f configs/jobs/70b_judge/generate_summaries_eval_gpt_job.yaml
```

This should take about ~10 min for the 8B model and the 70B model

## Get Evaluation Statistics

We've provided a convenient script [get_eval_stats.py](src/scripts/get_eval_stats.py) to get evaluation statistics and obtain the "win rate" of the DPO model (the percentage of times the DPO model performs better than the baseline). We've provided an example configuration below. 

```bash 
# make sure to substitute -outputs-path with your path
python src/scripts/get_eval_stats.py --outputs-path s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization-example/summary_generation_dpo_model/test/ --baseline-outputs-path s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization-example/summary_generation_base/test/  

# (Optional): if you obtained results for GPT-4o, you should uncomment and run the following command instead
# python src/scripts/get_eval_stats.py --outputs-path s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization-example/summary_generation_dpo_model/test/ --baseline-outputs-path s3://air-example-data/preference-tuning-summarization-example/summary_generation_base/test/  --gpt4o-outputs-path <add-path-to-gpt4o-results>
```

```

Our fine-tuned model is able to generate much better summaries, that are more concise (compression ratio is lower) with lesser out-of-distribution characters (gibberish tokens) than the baseline. You can see more details on the same in our blog!

| **NOTE:** The evaluation results will differ if you used the 8B model which is less capable as a LLM-judge (and thus the numbers can be less accurate)

## Summary

Congrats! You have now fine-tuned an open source model on preference data. As a quick recap, here's what we demonstrated in this notebook:
1. Synthetically generating preference data for DPO 
2. DPO fine-tuning of a language model on the Anyscale Platform
4. Evaluating the model against the baseline and GPT-4o, and analysing the results.
