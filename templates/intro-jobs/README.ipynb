    "1. Run a Ray app non-interactively in Anyscale as an \"Anyscale Job\".\n",

    "3. Submit jobs from Anyscale Workspaces as well as other other machines.\n",

    "Typically, we recommend running batch Ray apps as Anyscale Jobs when moving to production. Like workspaces, Anyscale Jobs run with their own Ray cluster, so you can run the exact same Ray program in a workspace as a Job too.\n",

    "- Automated failure handling\n",
    "- Automated email alerting\n",
    "- Record and persist outputs such as logs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Ray also has an internal concept of a \"Ray job\", which is created when running a Ray app. Anyscale Jobs, Workspaces, and Services all launch Ray jobs internally."
