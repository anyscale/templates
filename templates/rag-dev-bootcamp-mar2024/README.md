## Overview

In recent months, Retrieval Augmented Generation or RAG became a central concept in the LLM apps development. Developers are using RAG to reduce hallucinations by grounding LLM output and adding context that wasn’t captured in the LLM training data.


## Training Objectives

The RAG Developer Bootcamp is a 3-part training program designed to help developers understand and implement RAG in their LLM apps. The training program will cover three main areas:
- Part 1: RAG apps overview and quick-start with Canopy
- Part 2: RAG Development: embeddings at scale
- Part 3: RAG Development: evaluations

## Get Started

1. Open a terminal and run the following command to download the training materials:

```bash
wget https://anyscale-materials.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/rag-mar-2024.zip
```

2. unzip the files:

```bash
unzip rag-mar-2024.zip
```

3. Navigate to the `01_overview` folder and open the `notebook.ipynb` file to get started with the training program.
