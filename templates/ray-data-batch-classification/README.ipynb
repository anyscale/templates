    "Load the Imagenette dataset from an S3 bucket and create a Ray Dataset.\n",

    "- Load a pretrained ResNet model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Ray Data to preprocess the dataset and do model inference parallelizing across multiple GPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the predictions and save results to S3/local disk.\n",

In this class, we put the expensive model loading and initialization code in the `__init__` constructor, which will run only once. And we put the model inference code in the `__call__` method, which will be called for each batch.\n",

    "The `__call__` method takes a batch of data items, instead of a single one. In this case, the batch is a dict that has the `\"transformed_image\"` key populated by our preprocessing step, and the corresponding value is a Numpy array of images represented in `np.ndarray` format. We reuse the same inferencing logic from step 2."
