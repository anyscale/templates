    "Online LLM inference (e.g. Anyscale Endpoint) should be used when you want to get real-time response for prompt or to interact with the LLM. Use online inference when you want to optimize latency of inference to be as quick as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, offline LLM inference (also referred to as batch inference) should be used when you want to get reponses for a large number of prompts within some time frame, but not required to be real-time (minutes to hours granularity). Use offline inference when you want to:\n",
    "1. Scale your workload to large-scale datasets\n",
    "2. Optimize inference throughput and resource usage (for example, maximizing GPU utilization).\n",
    "\n",

    "Ray Data LLM is a library for running batch inference for LLMs. It uses Ray Data for data processing and provides an easy and flexible interface for the user to define their own workload. In this tutorial, we will implement a workload based on the [`CNNDailyMail`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) dataset, which is a collection of news articles. And we will summarize each article with our batch inferencing pipeline. We will cover more details on how to customize the workload in the later sections.\n"
