    "# Multimodal AI Pipeline with Ray Data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time to complete**: 30 min | **Difficulty**: Advanced | **Prerequisites**: ML experience, understanding of computer vision and NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a cutting-edge multimodal AI system that processes images and text together - like how humans understand memes, social media posts, or product listings that combine visual and textual information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Table of Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Multimodal Data Creation](#step-1-creating-multimodal-data) (7 min)\n",
    "2. [Image Processing](#step-2-image-feature-extraction) (8 min)\n",
    "3. [Text Processing](#step-3-text-feature-extraction) (8 min)\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this tutorial, you'll understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why multimodal AI matters**: How combining different data types creates smarter AI systems\n",
    "- **Ray Data's multimodal power**: Process images, text, and other data types in unified pipelines\n",
    "- **Real-world applications**: How companies like Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok analyze content\n",
    "- **Fusion techniques**: Combine information from different modalities for better predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Challenge**: Traditional AI processes one type of data at a time (just images OR just text). But real-world content is multimodal - think Instagram posts with images and captions, or product listings with photos and descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Solution**: Ray Data enables processing multiple data types in parallel, then combining their insights for more accurate and comprehensive AI understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-world Impact**:\n",
    "- **Social Media**: Analyze posts with images and captions for content moderation\n",
    "- **E-commerce**: Match product images with descriptions for better search\n",
    "- **Entertainment**: Understand video content with both visual and audio cues\n",
    "- **Healthcare**: Combine medical images with patient text records\n",
