        "**Why batch inference optimization matters**: Poor optimization wastes significant compute resources through repeated model loading and inefficient batching. Understanding these bottlenecks is crucial for production ML systems.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Real-world optimization patterns**: Netflix processes 200+ million inference requests daily for personalized recommendations using distributed ML systems. Tesla's autonomous driving systems perform real-time inference on sensor data from millions of vehicles. Google Search executes billions of ML inference operations for ranking and relevance. These patterns apply across industries from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles, search engines, and fraud detection systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Production deployment strategies**: Master GPU utilization, batch size tuning, and resource allocation techniques that enable ML systems to scale to enterprise workloads cost-effectively.\n",

        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "**Challenge**: Naive batch inference approaches create significant performance bottlenecks that prevent ML systems from scaling to production workloads. Model loading overhead can consume significant processing time, while poor batch sizing wastes GPU resources and increases operational costs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Solution**: Ray Data transforms batch inference through distributed processing and intelligent resource management. Actor-based model loading eliminates repeated initialization overhead, while optimized batching maximizes throughput across GPU clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Impact**: Production ML systems achieve significant performance improvements through Ray Data's inference optimization patterns. Companies process billions of inference requests using these distributed techniques for recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and real-time decision making.\n",
