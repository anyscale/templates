## Template Parts

This template is split into two parts for better learning progression:

| Part | Description | Time | File |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Part 1** | Inference Fundamentals | 20 min | [01-inference-fundamentals.md](01-inference-fundamentals.md) |
| **Part 2** | Advanced Optimization | 20 min | [02-advanced-optimization.md](02-advanced-optimization.md) |

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Inference Fundamentals
Learn the core concepts of batch inference optimization by comparing inefficient and efficient approaches:
- **Setup**: Initialize Ray Data for GPU-accelerated inference
- **The Wrong Way**: Understand anti-patterns that cause performance bottlenecks
- **Why It Fails**: Learn the technical reasons behind poor performance
- **The Right Way**: Implement optimized actor-based inference

### Part 2: Advanced Optimization
Master systematic optimization techniques for production deployment:
- **Decision Framework**: Learn when to use each optimization parameter
- **Advanced Techniques**: Multi-model ensembles, systematic parameter tuning
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use Ray Dashboard for optimization decisions
- **Production Deployment**: Best practices for enterprise-scale inference

## Learning Objectives

**Why batch inference optimization matters**: Poor optimization wastes significant compute resources through repeated model loading and inefficient batching. Understanding these bottlenecks is crucial for production ML systems.

**Ray Data's inference capabilities**: Stateful per-worker model loading and distributed processing eliminate performance bottlenecks that plague traditional ML pipelines.

**Real-world optimization patterns**: Production ML systems at companies like Netflix, Tesla, and search engines process millions of inference requests using distributed techniques.

## Overview

**Challenge**: Naive batch inference approaches create significant performance bottlenecks that prevent ML systems from scaling to production workloads. Model loading overhead can consume significant processing time, while poor batch sizing wastes GPU resources.

**Solution**: Ray Data transforms batch inference through distributed processing and intelligent resource management. Actor-based model loading eliminates repeated initialization overhead, while optimized batching maximizes throughput across GPU clusters.

**Impact**: Production ML systems achieve better performance through Ray Data's inference optimization patterns for recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles, and real-time decision making.
