# Batch Inference Optimization with Ray Data

**Time to complete**: 65 min (across 3 parts)

Create an optimized ML batch inference pipeline that demonstrates the performance difference between naive and efficient approaches. Learn how Ray Data's actor-based patterns eliminate common bottlenecks in production ML inference.

## Template Parts

This template is split into three parts for comprehensive learning:

| Part | Description | Time | File |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Part 1** | Inference Fundamentals | 20 min | [01-inference-fundamentals.md](01-inference-fundamentals.md) |
| **Part 2** | Advanced Optimization | 20 min | [02-advanced-optimization.md](02-advanced-optimization.md) |
| **Part 3** | Ray Data Architecture | 25 min | [03-ray-data-architecture.md](03-ray-data-architecture.md) |

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Inference Fundamentals
Learn the core concepts of batch inference optimization by comparing inefficient and efficient approaches:
- **Setup**: Initialize Ray Data for accelerated inference (CPU or GPU)
- **The Wrong Way**: Understand anti-patterns that cause performance bottlenecks
- **Why It Fails**: Learn the technical reasons behind poor performance
- **The Right Way**: Implement optimized actor-based inference (works on CPU and GPU)

### Part 2: Advanced Optimization
Master systematic optimization techniques for production deployment:
- **Decision Framework**: Learn when to use each optimization parameter
- **Advanced Techniques**: Multi-model ensembles, systematic parameter tuning
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use Ray Dashboard for optimization decisions
- **Production Deployment**: Best practices for enterprise-scale inference

### Part 3: Ray Data Architecture (NEW)
Understand how Ray Data's architecture enables optimization:
- **Streaming Execution**: How Ray Data processes unlimited datasets with constant memory
- **Blocks and Memory Model**: Understanding object store, heap memory, and zero-copy
- **Operators and Fusion**: How Ray Data combines operations for efficiency
- **Resource Management**: Automatic backpressure and dynamic allocation
- **Architecture-Informed Decisions**: Calculate optimal batch_size and concurrency from first principles

## Learning objectives

**Why batch inference optimization matters**: Poor optimization wastes significant compute resources through repeated model loading and inefficient batching. Understanding these bottlenecks is crucial for production ML systems.

**Ray Data's inference capabilities**: Stateful per-worker model loading and distributed processing eliminate performance bottlenecks that plague traditional ML pipelines.

**Real-world optimization patterns**: Production ML systems at companies like Netflix, Tesla, and search engines process millions of inference requests using distributed techniques.

## Overview

**Challenge**: Batch inference bottlenecks waste compute resources and slow ML pipelines:
- **Repeated model loading**: Loading 500MB+ models for every batch wastes 97% of time
- **Poor resource utilization**: Small batches leave CPUs/GPUs idle 90% of the time
- **Memory inefficiency**: Materializing full datasets causes OOM errors
- **Sequential processing**: Single-threaded inference limits throughput

**Solution**: Ray Data's actor-based inference eliminates common bottlenecks:

| Inference Challenge | Naive Approach | Ray Data Solution | Performance Impact |
|---------------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Model Loading** | Load per batch (2-5 sec) | Load once per actor (one-time cost) | 10-100x throughput improvement |
| **Batch Sizing** | Small batches (4-16 samples) | Optimized batches (32-128 samples) | 5-10x resource utilization |
| **Resource Management** | Manual allocation | Automatic with `num_gpus` (GPU) or `num_cpus` (CPU) | Zero configuration |
| **Concurrency** | Sequential or over-subscribed | Optimal actor pool with `concurrency` param | Maximum cluster efficiency |

:::tip Ray Data for ML Inference
Batch inference showcases Ray Data's strengths for ML workloads:
- **Stateful actors**: Models load once in `__init__()`, reused across 1000s of batches
- **Resource allocation**: `num_gpus=1` (GPU) or `num_cpus=2` (CPU) for proper resource management
- **Batch optimization**: `batch_size` parameter controls memory vs throughput
- **Concurrency tuning**: `concurrency` parameter matches cluster resources (GPUs or CPU cores)
- **Built-in monitoring**: Ray Dashboard shows resource utilization and bottlenecks
- **Universal patterns**: Same optimization patterns work on CPU-only and GPU clusters
:::

**Impact**: OpenAI processes billions of ChatGPT requests using Ray Serve (built on Ray Data patterns). Tesla analyzes millions of autonomous driving images using distributed inference. Netflix generates recommendations for 200M+ users using scalable ML pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Python 3.8+ with machine learning libraries
- [ ] Ray Data installed (`pip install ray[data]`)
- [ ] Basic understanding of ML model inference
- [ ] Familiarity with PyTorch or Transformers library (helpful but not required)

:::tip CPU and GPU Compatibility
**All examples work on both CPU-only and GPU clusters!**

- **GPU clusters**: Examples use `num_gpus=1` for optimal GPU acceleration
- **CPU clusters**: Simply set `num_gpus=0` or omit the parameter entirely

The optimization patterns and architecture concepts apply equally to both CPU and GPU workloads.

## Getting Started

**Recommended learning path**:

1. **Start with Part 1** - Understand fundamentals and common anti-patterns
2. **Continue to Part 2** - Master advanced optimization techniques
3. **Finish with Part 3** - Deep dive into Ray Data architecture and how it enables optimization

Each part builds on the previous, so complete them in order for the best learning experience.

**Alternative paths:**

**Quick path** (for immediate results):
- Part 1 only - Learn the basics and avoid common mistakes

**Architecture-focused path** (for deep understanding):
- Part 1 → Part 3 → Part 2 - Learn fundamentals, understand architecture, then advanced techniques

**Production path** (for deployment):
- Part 1 → Part 2 - Skip architecture deep-dive, focus on practical optimization
