## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Understanding of data quality concepts (completeness, accuracy, consistency)
- [ ] Experience with data validation and testing
- [ ] Familiarity with statistical concepts for anomaly detection
- [ ] Python environment with data processing libraries

## Quick Start (3 minutes)

### Setup and Dependencies

```python
import ray
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Initialize Ray for distributed processing
ray.init()
print("Ray initialized for data quality monitoring")
```

### Load Sample Dataset

```python
# Load pre-built customer dataset with realistic quality issues
customer_dataset = ray.data.read_parquet(
    "ecommerce_customers_with_quality_issues.parquet"
)

print(f"Loaded customer dataset with quality issues:")
print(f"  Records: {customer_dataset.count():,}")
print(f"  Schema: {customer_dataset.schema()}")

ds = customer_dataset
```

**What we have:**
- 100,000+ customer records with realistic data patterns
- Intentional quality issues: missing values, invalid data, outliers, duplicates
- Pre-built Parquet dataset for optimal Ray Data performance

## Step 1: Data Quality Setup

### Schema Validation

```python
# Check data schema and types
print("Data Schema Validation:")
print(f"Dataset schema: {ds.schema()}")
print(f"Record count: {ds.count():,}")

# Sample record structure
sample_record = ds.take(1)[0]
print(f"Sample record keys: {list(sample_record.keys())}")
```

### Basic Quality Overview

```python
# Simple data quality analysis
def analyze_basic_quality(dataset):
    """Quick quality overview using Ray Data operations."""
    total_records = dataset.count()
    sample_records = dataset.take(1000)
    
    print("Basic Quality Metrics:")
    print(f"  Total records: {total_records:,}")
    print(f"  Sample analyzed: {len(sample_records):,}")
    
    return sample_records

# Analyze our dataset
sample_data = analyze_basic_quality(ds)
```

## Step 2: Automated Quality Checks

### Missing Data Analysis

```python
# Use Ray Data native operations for missing data analysis
from ray.data.expressions import col

# Count missing values efficiently
def check_missing_values(dataset):
    """Analyze missing values using Ray Data operations."""
    sample_records = dataset.take(1000)  # Efficient sampling
    
    if not sample_records:
        return {}
    
    missing_stats = {}
    for key in sample_records[0].keys():
        missing_count = sum(1 for record in sample_records 
                          if record.get(key) is None or record.get(key) == '')
        missing_stats[key] = {
            'missing_count': missing_count,
            'missing_rate': missing_count / len(sample_records) * 100
        }
    
    return missing_stats

# Analyze missing data
missing_analysis = check_missing_values(ds)
```

#### Missing Data Summary

| Field | Missing Count | Missing Rate | Status |
|-------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **Email** | Sample analysis | Calculated % | High / Medium / Good |
| **Age** | Sample analysis | Calculated % | High / Medium / Good |
| **Income** | Sample analysis | Calculated % | High / Medium / Good |

### Simple Quality Visualization

```python
# Create focused quality chart
def create_simple_quality_chart(missing_stats):
    """Create a simple, focused quality chart."""
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    if not missing_stats:
        print("No missing data statistics available")
        return
    
    fields = list(missing_stats.keys())
    missing_rates = [stats['missing_rate'] for stats in missing_stats.values()]
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    colors = ['red' if rate > 10 else 'orange' if rate > 5 else 'green' for rate in missing_rates]
    plt.bar(fields, missing_rates, color=colors, alpha=0.7)
    plt.title('Missing Data Analysis')
    plt.ylabel('Missing Rate (%)')
    plt.xticks(rotation=45)
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    
    print("Quality chart generated successfully")

# Generate focused chart
create_simple_quality_chart(missing_analysis)
```

### Accuracy Validation

```python
# Email validation using Ray Data filtering
def validate_email_format(dataset):
    """Validate email formats using Ray Data operations."""
    
    # Use simple lambda filtering for email validation
    valid_emails = dataset.filter(
        lambda record: '@' in str(record.get('email', ''))
    )
    total_records = dataset.count()
    valid_count = valid_emails.count()
    
    return {
        'total_records': total_records,
        'valid_emails': valid_count,
        'validity_rate': (valid_count / total_records * 100) if total_records > 0 else 0
    }

# Run email validation
email_validation = validate_email_format(ds)
print(f"Email validation: {email_validation['validity_rate']:.1f}% valid formats")
```

## Step 3: Data Drift Monitoring

### Statistical Analysis with Native Ray Data

```python
# Use Ray Data native aggregations for statistical analysis
from ray.data.aggregate import Count, Mean, Std, Min, Max

# Calculate statistics for numeric columns
try:
    age_stats = ds.aggregate(
        Count(),
        Mean('age'),
        Std('age'),
        Min('age'),
        Max('age')
    )
    print("Age Statistics:")
    print(f"  Count: {age_stats['count()']:,}")
    print(f"  Mean: {age_stats['mean(age)']:.1f}")
    print(f"  Std Dev: {age_stats['std(age)']:.1f}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Age statistics calculation: {e}")
```

#### Quality Statistics Summary

| Metric | Age | Income | Score |
|--------|-----|--------|-------|
| **Count** | Native Ray Data aggregation | Native calculation | Native calculation |
| **Mean** | Distributed processing | Distributed processing | Distributed processing |
| **Std Dev** | Scalable statistics | Scalable statistics | Scalable statistics |

## Step 4: Quality Reporting

### Generate Quality Report

```python
# Create comprehensive quality report
def generate_quality_report(dataset, missing_stats, email_validation):
    """Generate a comprehensive quality report."""
    total_records = dataset.count()
    
    print("="*60)
    print("DATA QUALITY REPORT")
    print("="*60)
    print(f"Dataset size: {total_records:,} records")
    print(f"Email validity: {email_validation['validity_rate']:.1f}%")
    
    # Missing data summary
    print("\nMissing Data Summary:")
    for field, stats in missing_stats.items():
        status = "High" if stats['missing_rate'] > 10 else "Medium" if stats['missing_rate'] > 5 else "Good"
        print(f"  {field}: {stats['missing_rate']:.1f}% missing {status}")
    
    print("="*60)

# Generate final report
generate_quality_report(ds, missing_analysis, email_validation)
```

### Quality Score Calculation

```python
# Calculate overall quality score using native operations
def calculate_quality_score_native(dataset):
    """Calculate quality score using Ray Data operations."""
    total_records = dataset.count()
    
    # Find records with complete critical fields using lambda filtering
    complete_records = dataset.filter(
        lambda record: (
            record.get('email') is not None and 
            record.get('age') is not None and
            str(record.get('email', '')) != '' and
            str(record.get('email', '')) != 'None'
        )
    ).count()
    
    completeness_score = complete_records / total_records if total_records > 0 else 0
    
    quality_result = {
        "total_records": total_records,
        "complete_records": complete_records,
        "completeness_score": completeness_score,
        "quality_grade": "A" if completeness_score > 0.9 else "B" if completeness_score > 0.7 else "C"
    }
    
    return quality_result

# Calculate quality score
overall_quality = calculate_quality_score_native(ds)
print(f"Overall Quality: {overall_quality['completeness_score']:.1%} (Grade: {overall_quality['quality_grade']})")
```
