## Template Parts

This template is split into two parts for better learning progression:

| Part | Description | Time | File |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Part 1** | Financial Data and Indicators | 15 min | [01-financial-data-indicators.md](01-financial-data-indicators.md) |
| **Part 2** | Forecasting and Portfolio Analysis | 15 min | [02-forecasting-portfolio.md](02-forecasting-portfolio.md) |

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Financial Data and Indicators
Learn to process real market data and calculate professional technical indicators:
- **Data Loading**: Load real stock market data from public sources
- **Technical Indicators**: Calculate moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Data Visualization**: Create financial charts and market analysis dashboards
- **Ray Data Operations**: Use groupby, aggregations, and transformations for financial analytics

### Part 2: Forecasting and Portfolio Analysis
Master time series forecasting and portfolio optimization:
- **AutoARIMA Forecasting**: Automated time series forecasting for stock prices
- **Portfolio Optimization**: Modern portfolio theory and risk analysis
- **Advanced Visualizations**: Interactive forecasting and portfolio dashboards
- **Production Deployment**: Best practices for financial analytics systems

## Learning Objectives

**Why financial analytics matters**: Trading systems process large volumes of market data daily, requiring efficient processing for financial decision-making.

**Ray Data's financial capabilities**: Distribute calculations like portfolio optimization, risk modeling, and technical indicators across computing clusters.

**Real-world trading applications**: Techniques used by financial institutions for algorithmic trading systems.

## Overview

**Challenge**: Financial institutions face data-intensive analytics requirements:
- **Volume**: Process 100M+ trades and quotes daily across global markets
- **Velocity**: Calculate technical indicators in real-time for trading decisions
- **Variety**: Integrate stock prices, news, earnings, and alternative data
- **Complexity**: Portfolio optimization requires millions of simulations

**Solution**: Ray Data enables production-scale financial analytics:

| Financial Task | Traditional Approach | Ray Data Approach | Trading Benefit |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Technical Indicators** | Sequential calculation per stock | Parallel `map_batches()` across portfolio | Real-time indicators for 1000s of symbols |
| **Risk Calculations** | Single-machine VaR/CVaR | Distributed Monte Carlo with `groupby()` | Portfolio risk in seconds not hours |
| **Backtesting** | Days to backtest strategies | Parallel strategy evaluation | Test 100s of strategies simultaneously |
| **Data Integration** | Manual joins and merging | Native `join()` operations | Seamless multi-source integration |
