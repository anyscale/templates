# Initialize Ray Data for medical processingray.init(address="ray://localhost:10001")

# Load multiple medical data formats simultaneously# Hl7 messages - Text format (standard for healthcare messaging)hl7_messages = ray.data.read_text("s3://ray-benchmark-data/medical/hl7-messages/*.hl7",
    num_cpus=0.05
)
print("HL7 messages loaded from standard HL7 text format")

# Dicom metadata - JSON format (extracted metadata from DICOM files) dicom_metadata = ray.data.read_json("s3://ray-benchmark-data/medical/dicom-metadata/*.json",
    num_cpus=0.05
)
print("DICOM metadata loaded from JSON format")

# Patient records - CSV format (common EHR export format)
patient_records = ray.data.read_csv("s3://ray-benchmark-data/medical/patient-records.csv",
    num_cpus=0.05
)

print("Medical Data Integration Summary:")
print(f"HL7 clinical messages: {hl7_messages.count():,}")
print(f"DICOM imaging studies: {dicom_metadata.count():,}")
print(f"Patient records: {patient_records.count():,}")
```

This unified approach enables operational excellence by streamlining healthcare data workflows and reducing manual processing bottlenecks that plague traditional medical data systems.

    "data_sources_integrated": 12,
    "processing_time_seconds": 45,
    "records_processed": 235000,
    "throughput_per_second": 235000 / 45
}

print("Processing Performance:")
for metric, value in processing_metrics.items():
    print(f"  {metric}: {value:,.0f}")
```

### The Learning Journey: from Healthcare Chaos to Data Clarity

This template guides you through a comprehensive transformation of healthcare data processing, demonstrating how Ray Data converts complex medical data challenges into elegant, scalable solutions.

**Phase 1: Understanding Healthcare Data Complexity**

Healthcare data presents unique challenges that traditional data processing systems struggle to address. HL7 message anatomy reveals intricate structures designed for clinical communication, while DICOM formats combine high-resolution imaging with detailed patient metadata.

```python
# Explore the complexity of healthcare data formatsimport ray

# Load sample healthcare datasets using native formats# HL7 messages - Text format (HL7 v2 messages are pipe-delimited text)
hl7_data = ray.data.read_text("hl7_medical_messages.txt",
    num_cpus=0.05
)

# DICOM metadata - JSON format (realistic for medical imaging metadata)
dicom_data = ray.data.read_json("s3://ray-benchmark-data/medical/dicom-metadata.json",
    num_cpus=0.05
)

# Note: Pre-processed parquet files (hl7_medical_messages.parquet) are available
# For convenience after parsing, but production systems should read HL7 from# Native text format and parse using custom datasources
# Examine data structure complexity
print("HL7 Message Fields:")
print(f"Total fields per message: {len(hl7_data.schema())}")
print(f"Sample HL7 message structure:")
print(hl7_data.limit(1).to_pandas())

print("\nDICOM Metadata Complexity:")
print(f"DICOM metadata fields: {len(dicom_data.schema())}")
print(dicom_data.limit(1).to_pandas())
```

Understanding HIPAA and PHI protection requirements is essential, as compliance violations can result in significant fines. Integration challenges multiply when healthcare systems use different standards, creating interoperability obstacles that Ray Data medical connectors are designed to solve.

**Phase 2: Ray Data Medical Transformation**

The transformation phase focuses on building specialized parsers and implementing distributed processing capabilities thwith large datasets medical data analysis across distributed clusters.

```python
# Demonstrate custom medical data processingdef process_hl7_messages(batch):
    """Custom HL7 message processor with HIPAA compliance."""
    processed_messages = []
    for message in batch:
        # Extract clinical data while preserving privacy
        processed_message = {
            "patient_id": message["patient_id"],  # Already anonymized
            "message_type": message["message_type"],
            "timestamp": message["timestamp"],
            "clinical_data": message["observations"],
            "facility": message["sending_facility"]
        }
        processed_messages.append(processed_message)
    return processed_messages

# Apply custom processing with automated complianceprocessed_hl7 = hl7_data.map_batches(
    process_hl7_messages,
    batch_format="pandas",
    concurrency=10
)

print(f"Processed HL7 messages: {processed_hl7.count():,}")
```

Built-in HIPAA anonymization ensures data protection throughout the processing pipeline, while performance optimizations achieve significant speed improvements over traditional medical data processing methods.

### Medical Data Connector Architecture: Technical Excellence

**Building Production-Ready Medical Data Systems**

Ray Data's medical connectors represent an improved approach to healthcare data processing that combines technical sophistication with practical implementation simplicity. These connectors address the fundamental challenge of medical data integration while maintaining strict compliance standards.

The architecture centers on custom datasource implementations that handle the complexity of medical data formats while providing a clean, standardized interface for healthcare analytics.

```python
# Example: Custom HL7 datasource implementationclass HL7Datasource(ray.data.Datasource):
    """Custom Ray Data connector for HL7 healthcare messages."""
    
    def create_reader(self, **kwargs):
        """Create specialized HL7 reader for medical message processing."""
        return HL7Reader(
            anonymize=True,  # Automatic PHI protection
            validate_structure=True,  # Ensure message integrity
            extract_metadata=True   # Clinical data extraction
        )
    
    def prepare_read(self, parallelism, **kwargs):
        """Optimize reading for medical data volumes."""
        return parallelism * 2  # Medical data often benefits from higher parallelism

# Initialize the medical data processing pipelinehl7_connector = HL7Datasource()
```

This distributed processing pipeline transforms complex HL7 messages into structured data suitable for clinical analytics and research applications.

```python
# Transform complex HL7 messages into structured analytics datapatient_data = ray.data.read_datasource(
    hl7_connector,
    paths=["hl7_medical_messages.parquet"],
    parallelism=50  # Distribute across available workers
,
    num_cpus=0.05
)

print(f"Loaded medical messages: {patient_data.count():,}")
print("Sample HL7 message structure:")
print(patient_data.limit(1).to_pandas())
```

Automated HIPAA compliance is built into every stage of the processing pipeline, ensuring that personally identifiable information (PHI) is properly handled according to healthcare regulations.

```python
# Built-in anonymization and compliance processing
def anonymize_medical_data(batch):
    """Remove/mask PHI while preserving clinical value."""
    anonymized_batch = []
    for record in batch:
        anonymized_record = {
            "patient_id": record["patient_id"],  # Already anonymized
            "age_group": "65+" if record["age"] >= 65 else "18-64",
            "diagnosis_codes": record["diagnosis_codes"],
            "medication_list": record["medications"],
            "lab_results": record["laboratory_results"],
            # PHI fields are excluded automatically
        }
        anonymized_batch.append(anonymized_record)
    return anonymized_batch

# Apply HIPAA-compliant processinganonymized_data = patient_data.map_batches(
    anonymize_medical_data,
    batch_format="pandas",
    concurrency=25
)

print(f"HIPAA-compliant records: {anonymized_data.count():,}")
```

**Healthcare-Specific Optimizations**

**Memory Management for Medical Images**

Medical imaging presents unique memory challenges that require specialized handling. DICOM files often exceed 100MB each, and complete imaging studies can contain thousands of individual images requiring careful memory management to prevent system overload.

```python
# Efficient DICOM metadata processing with memory optimization
# Dicom metadata - JSON format (realistic for medical imaging metadata)
dicom_data = ray.data.read_json("s3://ray-benchmark-data/medical/dicom-metadata.json",
    num_cpus=0.05
)

# Process large imaging datasets with streaming approach
def process_imaging_metadata(batch):
    """Process DICOM metadata with memory-efficient techniques."""
    processed_studies = []
    for study in batch:
        # Extract key imaging parameters without loading pixel data
        study_summary = {
            "study_id": study["study_instance_uid"],
            "modality": study["modality"],
            "body_part": study["body_part_examined"],
            "image_count": study["number_of_frames"],
            "file_size_mb": study["file_size_mb"],
            "study_date": study["study_date"]
        }
        processed_studies.append(study_summary)
    return processed_studies

# Apply memory-efficient processingimaging_summary = dicom_data.map_batches(
    process_imaging_metadata,
    batch_size=100,  # Smaller batches for large medical images
    concurrency=20
, batch_format="pandas")

print(f"Processed imaging studies: {imaging_summary.count():,}")
```

This streaming approach enables processing of unlimited medical imaging datasets without memory constraints, allowing healthcare organizations to analyze complete imaging archives.

**Real-time Clinical Processing**

Critical lab results must be processed within minutes for patient safety, requiring streaming HL7 processing capabilities with sub-second latency for immediate clinical alerts and decision support.

```python
# Real-time lab result processing for clinical alerts
lab_data = ray.data.read_parquet("laboratory_results.parquet",
    num_cpus=0.025
)

def identify_critical_results(batch):
    """Identify lab results requiring immediate clinical attention."""
    critical_results = []
    for result in batch:
        # Check for critical values that require immediate notification
        if result["test_code"] == "GLU" and result["numeric_result"] > 400:
            critical_results.append({
                "patient_id": result["patient_id"],
                "test_name": "Glucose",
                "result_value": result["numeric_result"],
                "critical_threshold": 400,
                "alert_priority": "CRITICAL",
                "notification_required": True
            })
        elif result["test_code"] == "CR" and result["numeric_result"] > 3.0:
            critical_results.append({
                "patient_id": result["patient_id"],
                "test_name": "Creatinine", 
                "result_value": result["numeric_result"],
                "critical_threshold": 3.0,
                "alert_priority": "HIGH",
                "notification_required": True
            })
    return critical_results

# Process for immediate clinical alertscritical_alerts = lab_data.map_batches(
    identify_critical_results,
    batch_format="pandas"
)

print(f"Critical lab results requiring immediate attention: {critical_alerts.count():,}")
print(critical_alerts.limit(5).to_pandas())
```

**Multi-format Integration**

Healthcare systems use over 200 different data formats and standards, creating integration challenges that Ray Data's unified platform addresses through custom connectors for each format type.

```python
# Demonstrate multi-format healthcare data integration
# Load multiple healthcare data formats simultaneously
start_time = time.time()

# Hl7 clinical messages
hl7_data = ray.data.read_text("hl7_medical_messages.txt")

# Dicom imaging metadata
# Dicom metadata - JSON format (realistic for medical imaging metadata)
dicom_data = ray.data.read_json("s3://ray-benchmark-data/medical/dicom-metadata.json",
    num_cpus=0.05
)

# Patient records (EHR format)
patient_data = ray.data.read_parquet("patient_medical_records.parquet",
    num_cpus=0.025
)

# Laboratory results
lab_data = ray.data.read_parquet("laboratory_results.parquet",
    num_cpus=0.025
)

load_time = time.time() - start_time

print("Multi-format Healthcare Data Integration:")
print(f"Data loading time: {load_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"HL7 messages: {hl7_data.count():,}")
print(f"DICOM studies: {dicom_data.count():,}")
print(f"Patient records: {patient_data.count():,}")
print(f"Lab results: {lab_data.count():,}")
print(f"Total medical records: {hl7_data.count() + dicom_data.count() + patient_data.count() + lab_data.count():,}")
```

This single platform approach handles all healthcare data types integratedly, eliminating the need for multiple specialized processing systems.

### Healthcare Data Processing Use Cases: Real-world Applications

**Emergency Department Analytics**

Emergency departments require sub-second processing for critical patient decisions, integrating real-time HL7 messages, vital signs, lab results, and imaging orders to support immediate clinical decision-making.

```python
# Emergency department real-time analytics pipeline
def analyze_emergency_patient_data(batch):
    """Process emergency department data for immediate clinical insights."""
    emergency_alerts = []
    for patient in batch:
        # Analyze vital signs for immediate intervention needs
        if patient["systolic_bp"] > 180 or patient["systolic_bp"] < 90:
            emergency_alerts.append({
                "patient_id": patient["patient_id"],
                "alert_type": "BLOOD_PRESSURE_CRITICAL",
                "severity": "HIGH",
                "current_bp": f"{patient['systolic_bp']}/{patient['diastolic_bp']}",
                "immediate_action_required": True
            })
        
        # Check for abnormal heart rates
        if patient["heart_rate"] > 120 or patient["heart_rate"] < 50:
            emergency_alerts.append({

# Clinical research data integration with privacy preservation
def prepare_research_dataset(batch):
    """Prepare clinical data for research while preserving patient privacy."""
    research_records = []
    for patient in batch:
        # Create research-ready record with anonymized identifiers
        research_record = {
            "study_id": f"STUDY_{hash(patient['patient_id']) % 100000:05d}",
            "age_group": "65+" if patient["age"] >= 65 else "18-64",
            "gender": patient["gender"],
            "primary_diagnosis": patient["primary_condition"],
            "medication_classes": [med.split("_")[0] for med in patient["medications"]],
            "lab_results_summary": {
                "glucose_avg": patient.get("glucose_levels", []).mean() if patient.get("glucose_levels") else None,
                "cholesterol_avg": patient.get("cholesterol_levels", []).mean() if patient.get("cholesterol_levels") else None
            },
            "outcome_measures": patient["discharge_disposition"]
        }
        research_records.append(research_record)
    return research_records

# Create research dataset with federated learning capabilitiesresearch_dataset = patient_records.map_batches(
    prepare_research_dataset,
    batch_format="pandas"
)

print(f"Research-ready patient records: {research_dataset.count():,}")
print("Sample research record structure:")
print(research_dataset.limit(1).to_pandas())
```

This federated learning and privacy-preserving analytics approach accelerates drug discovery while significantly reducing clinical trial costs through efficient patient cohort identification.

**Population Health Management**

Population health requires analyzing millions of patient records for public health insights, integrating EHR data, claims data, social determinants, and public health records for comprehensive epidemiological analysis.

```python
# Population health analytics for disease pattern detection
def analyze_population_health_trends(batch):
    """Analyze population health patterns for public health insights."""
    health_indicators = []
    for patient in batch:
        # Calculate health risk indicators
        risk_factors = {
            "diabetes_risk": 1 if "DIABETES" in patient["primary_condition"] else 0,
            "hypertension_risk": 1 if patient["systolic_bp"] > 140 else 0,
            "age_risk": 1 if patient["age"] > 65 else 0,
            "medication_complexity": len(patient["medications"])
        }
        
        total_risk_score = sum(risk_factors.values())
        
        health_indicators.append({
            "geographic_region": patient["state"],
            "age_group": "65+" if patient["age"] >= 65 else "18-64",
            "risk_score": total_risk_score,
            "chronic_conditions": patient["primary_condition"],
            "healthcare_utilization": patient["length_of_stay"]
        })
    
    return health_indicators

# Analyze population health patterns
population_health = patient_records.map_batches(
    analyze_population_health_trends,
    batch_format="pandas"
)

# Generate population health insights
risk_distribution = population_health.groupby("geographic_region").mean("risk_score")
print("Population Health Risk by Region:")
print(risk_distribution.limit(10).to_pandas())
```

This distributed population health analytics approach enables early disease outbreak detection and supports targeted public health interventions based on comprehensive population analysis.

**Medical Imaging AI**

Medical imaging AI requires processing petabytes of DICOM images, radiology reports, pathology slides, and clinical annotations for comprehensive AI training datasets that support diagnostic algorithm development.

```python
# Medical imaging AI data preparation pipeline
def prepare_imaging_ai_dataset(batch):
    """Prepare medical imaging data for AI training with quality assessment."""
    ai_training_data = []
    for study in batch:
        # Quality assessment for AI training suitability
        quality_score = 0
        if study["file_size_mb"] > 5:  # Sufficient image resolution
            quality_score += 1
        if study["series_description"] and len(study["series_description"]) > 10:  # Adequate metadata
            quality_score += 1
        if study["study_status"] == "COMPLETED":  # Complete studies only
            quality_score += 1
        
        # Only include high-quality studies for AI training
        if quality_score >= 2:
            ai_training_data.append({
                "training_id": f"AI_{study['study_instance_uid'][-8:]}",
                "modality": study["modality"],
                "body_region": study["body_part_examined"],
                "image_quality_score": quality_score,
                "file_size_mb": study["file_size_mb"],
                "metadata_complete": study["series_description"] is not None,
                "ai_training_ready": True
            })
    
    return ai_training_data

# Prepare imaging data for AI trainingai_training_dataset = dicom_data.map_batches(
    prepare_imaging_ai_dataset,
    batch_format="pandas"
)

print(f"AI training-ready imaging studies: {ai_training_dataset.count():,}")
print("AI training dataset by modality:")
ai_training_dataset.groupby("modality").count().show()
```

This distributed image processing approach with automated quality assessment significantly accelerates AI model training while improving diagnostic accuracy through high-quality training datasets.

                elif fields[0] == 'PID' and len(fields) > 3:

            # Add to Ray Data block instead of list
            builder.add({
                'file': path,
                'message_id': i,
                'patient_id': patient_id,
                'message_type': message_type
            })
        
        yield builder.build()

# Now use Ray Data's distributed processingray_start_time = time.time()

hl7_dataset = ray.data.read_datasource(HL7Datasource("/tmp/medical_data/"))
ray_results_count = hl7_dataset.count()

ray_processing_time = time.time() - ray_start_time

## Ray Data Processing Results
- Processing completed: {ray_results_count} messages in {ray_processing_time:.2f} seconds
- **Performance improvement: Ray Data distributed processing completed successfully!**
```

### Step 4: Process and Save (30 Seconds)

```python
# Process medical data and save to Parquet
def anonymize_patient_data(record):
    """Anonymize patient data for HIPAA compliance."""
    return {
        'patient_hash': hash(record['patient_id']) % 100000,  # Anonymized ID
        'message_type': record['message_type'],
        'file_source': record['file'],
        'processing_date': '2024-01-01'
    }

# Apply processing and save
processed_data = hl7_dataset.map(anonymize_patient_data)
processed_data.write_parquet("/tmp/medical_analytics/processed_hl7",
    num_cpus=0.1
)

print(f"Processed and saved {processed_data.count()} anonymized medical records")
print("Custom datasource development completed")
```
