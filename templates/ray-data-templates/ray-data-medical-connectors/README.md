# Medical Data Processing and HIPAA Compliance with Ray Data

**⏱️ Time to complete**: 35 min (across 2 parts)

Create a HIPAA-compliant medical data processing pipeline that handles healthcare records (HL7 messages) and medical images (DICOM) with large datasets.

## Template Parts

This template is split into two parts for better learning progression:

| Part | Description | Time | File |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Part 1** | Healthcare Data Connectors | 17 min | [01-healthcare-data-connectors.md](01-healthcare-data-connectors.md) |
| **Part 2** | Medical Imaging and Compliance | 18 min | [02-medical-imaging-compliance.md](02-medical-imaging-compliance.md) |

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Healthcare Data Connectors
Learn to build custom Ray Data datasources for medical data:
- **HL7 Message Processing**: Parse healthcare messaging standards
- **Custom Datasources**: Build reusable connectors for proprietary formats
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Implement patient data anonymization
- **Quick Start**: Process medical data in 5 minutes

### Part 2: Medical Imaging and Compliance
Extend to medical imaging and production deployment:
- **DICOM Image Processing**: Handle medical imaging data
- **Advanced Compliance**: Complete HIPAA compliance framework
- **Production Patterns**: Enterprise deployment strategies
- **Medical Analytics**: Healthcare insights and visualizations

## Learning Objectives

**Why healthcare data processing matters**: Healthcare data is complex, sensitive, and highly regulated. Understanding how to process medical data while maintaining HIPAA compliance is crucial for healthcare analytics.

**Ray Data's healthcare capabilities**: Process sensitive medical data with built-in privacy protection and HIPAA compliance patterns using custom datasources for proprietary formats.

**Real-world medical applications**: Techniques used by hospitals and health systems to analyze patient data for improved healthcare outcomes.

## Overview

**The Challenge**: Healthcare data comes in complex, proprietary formats (HL7, DICOM) that require specialized processing while maintaining strict privacy and compliance requirements.

**The Solution**: Ray Data's custom datasource framework enables scalable processing of any medical data format while maintaining HIPAA compliance and enabling healthcare analytics.

**Real-world Impact**:
- **Hospitals**: Process thousands of patient records for predictive analytics
- **Research**: Analyze clinical trial data across multiple institutions
- **Public Health**: Track disease patterns and health outcomes at population scale
- **Pharma**: Drug discovery and safety analysis across massive datasets
