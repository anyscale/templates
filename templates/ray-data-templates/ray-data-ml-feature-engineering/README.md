## Quick start (3 minutes)

This section demonstrates the concepts using Ray Data:

```python

import pandas as pd
import ray

# Load real Titanic dataset for feature engineering demonstrationprint("Loading Titanic dataset for feature engineering...")
start_time = time.time()

# Load Titanic dataset from Ray benchmark buckettitanic_data = ray.data.read_csv(

print(f"Loaded Titanic dataset in {load_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Dataset size: {titanic_data.count():,} passengers")
print(f"Schema: {titanic_data.schema()}")

# Show sample data to understand the structureprint("\nSample passenger data:")
samples = titanic_data.take(3)
for i, sample in enumerate(samples):
    print(f"  {i+1}. Passenger {sample.get('PassengerId', 'N/A')}: Age {sample.get('Age', 'N/A')}, "
          f"Class {sample.get('Pclass', 'N/A')}, Survived: {sample.get('Survived', 'N/A')}")

**Industry Success Stories**

Leading companies demonstrate the significant power of efficient feature engineering. Netflix discovered that "time since last similar movie watched" predicts viewing behavior more accurately than simple genre categorization. Uber's pricing algorithms rely heavily on "ratio of supply to demand in area" rather than absolute numbers, while Amazon's recommendation engine leverages "purchase frequency in category" to outperform individual purchase-based features.

```python
# Example: Creating family and social features from Titanic datadef create_family_features(batch):
    """Engineer family and social features from Titanic dataset."""
    family_features = []
    for passenger in batch:
        # Calculate family size
        family_size = passenger['SibSp'] + passenger['Parch'] + 1
        
        # Extract title from name
        name = passenger.get('Name', '')
        title = 'Unknown'
        if 'Mr.' in name:
            title = 'Mr'
        elif 'Mrs.' in name:
            title = 'Mrs'
        elif 'Miss.' in name:
            title = 'Miss'
        elif 'Master.' in name:
            title = 'Master'
        elif 'Dr.' in name:
            title = 'Dr'
        
        # Create feature-engineered passenger record
        family_features = {
            'family_size': family_size,
            'is_alone': 1 if family_size == 1 else 0,
            'large_family': 1 if family_size > 4 else 0,
            'title': title,
            'is_child': 1 if passenger.get('Age', 999) < 16 else 0,
            'fare_per_person': passenger.get('Fare', 0) / max(family_size, 1)
        }
        
        family_features.append({**passenger, **family_data})
    
    return family_features

# Apply family feature engineering to Titanic datafamily_enhanced_data = dataset.map_batches(
    create_family_features,
    batch_format="pandas"
)

print("Family and social features created successfully")
print(f"Enhanced dataset size: {family_enhanced_data.count():,} passengers")
```

**The Feature Engineering Challenge at Scale**

Modern ML systems face large challenges in feature engineering. Scale becomes critical when datasets contain billions of rows and thousands of potential features, while complexity grows exponentially as interaction features create vast feature spaces. Performance bottlenecks often emerge in the feature engineering stage rather than model training, and poor feature quality consistently leads to poor models regardless of algorithm sophistication.

Automation becomes essential because manual feature engineering cannot scale to enterprise data volumes. E-commerce platforms must create 500+ features from customer behavior, product catalogs, and transaction histories. Financial services require 1000+ risk indicators from market data, credit histories, and economic factors. Healthcare organizations transform patient records, lab results, and imaging data into predictive features, while manufacturing companies convert sensor data, maintenance logs, and production metrics into quality predictors.

```python
# Example: Automated feature selection with large datasetsdef automated_feature_selection(dataset, target_column, max_features=100):
    """Automatically select the most predictive features."""
    
    # Calculate feature importance scores
    def calculate_feature_importance(batch):

    """Calculate Feature Importance."""
        # Simplified correlation-based feature scoring
        correlations = []
        for column in batch.columns:
            if column != target_column:
                correlation = abs(batch[column].corr(batch[target_column]))
                correlations.append((column, correlation))
        return correlations
    
    # Apply feature selection across distributed data
    feature_scores = dataset.map_batches(
        calculate_feature_importance,
        batch_format="pandas"
    )
    
    print(f"Automated feature selection identified top {max_features} features")
    return feature_scores

# Demonstrate automated feature selectionselected_features = automated_feature_selection(enhanced_data, 'target_variable')
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "memory Errors During Feature Creation"
**Solution**:
```python
# Reduce batch size for memory-intensive feature engineeringdataset.map_batches(feature_function, batch_size=1000, concurrency=2, batch_format="pandas")
```

### Problem: "features Have Nan or Infinite Values"
**Solution**:
```python
# Add validation and cleaning for feature valuesdef clean_features(features):

    """Clean Features."""
    return np.nan_to_num(features, nan=0.0, posinf=1e6, neginf=-1e6)
```

### Problem: "feature Selection Takes Too Long"
**Solution**:
```python
# Use correlation-based pre-filtering before statistical testshigh_corr_features = df.corr().abs().sum().nlargest(100).index
```

### Problem: "categorical Encoding Creates Too Many Features"
**Solution**:
```python
# Limit high-cardinality categorical featuresdef limit_categories(series, max_categories=20):
    top_categories = series.value_counts().head(max_categories).index
    return series.where(series.isin(top_categories), 'Other')
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Feature Caching**: Cache expensive feature calculations for reuse
2. **Parallel Processing**: Use Ray's parallelization for independent features
3. **Memory Management**: Process features in chunks for large datasets
4. **Data Types**: Use appropriate data types to minimize memory usage
5. **Feature Pruning**: Remove redundant features early in the pipeline

### Performance Considerations

Ray Data provides several advantages for feature engineering:
- **Parallel computation**: Feature calculations are distributed across multiple workers
- **Memory efficiency**: Large datasets are processed in batches to avoid memory issues  
- **Scalability**: The same code patterns work for thousands to millions of samples
- **Resource optimization**: Automatic load balancing across available CPU cores

```python
# Memory-efficient feature engineering patternsdef memory_efficient_features(batch):
    """Create features with minimal memory overhead."""
    # Process records directly without DataFrame conversion
    feature_records = []
    for record in batch:
        # Calculate features using simple operations
        features = {
            'original_feature': record.get('value', 0),
            'derived_feature': record.get('value', 0) * 2,
            'categorical_feature': 'high' if record.get('value', 0) > 100 else 'low'
        }
        feature_records.append({**record, **features})
    return feature_records

# Apply with optimal settingsfeature_dataset = dataset.map_batches(
    memory_efficient_features,
    batch_size=2000,  # Balanced for memory and performance
    concurrency=4     # Parallel processing
, batch_format="pandas")
```
