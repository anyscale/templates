## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, ensure you have:
- [ ] Understanding of machine learning fundamentals
- [ ] Experience with data preprocessing concepts
- [ ] Familiarity with pandas and data manipulation
- [ ] Knowledge of feature types (numerical, categorical, text)

## Quick start (3 minutes)

This section demonstrates the concepts using Ray Data:

```python
import time

import pandas as pd
import ray

# Initialize Ray for distributed processing
ray.init()

# Load real Titanic dataset for feature engineering demonstration
print("Loading Titanic dataset for feature engineering...")
start_time = time.time()

# Load Titanic dataset from Ray benchmark bucket
titanic_data = ray.data.read_csv(
    "s3://ray-benchmark-data/ml-datasets/titanic.csv",
    num_cpus=0.05
)

load_time = time.time() - start_time

print(f"Loaded Titanic dataset in {load_time:.2f} seconds")
print(f"Dataset size: {titanic_data.count():,} passengers")
print(f"Schema: {titanic_data.schema()}")

# Show sample data to understand the structure
print("\nSample passenger data:")
samples = titanic_data.take(3)
for i, sample in enumerate(samples):
    print(f"  {i+1}. Passenger {sample.get('PassengerId', 'N/A')}: Age {sample.get('Age', 'N/A')}, "
          f"Class {sample.get('Pclass', 'N/A')}, Survived: {sample.get('Survived', 'N/A')}")

# Use this real dataset for feature engineering demonstrations
dataset = titanic_data
```

## Why Feature Engineering Is the Secret to ML Success

**The 80/20 Rule**: 80% of ML model performance comes from feature quality, only 20% from algorithm choice.

### Titanic Dataset Exploration and Feature Insights

Explore the Titanic dataset to understand feature relationships and engineering opportunities.

**Key insights from the data:**
- First class passengers had higher survival rates than third class
- Family size of 2-4 shows highest survival rates  
- Titles extracted from names (Mrs, Miss, Master) correlate with survival
- Age and fare show moderate correlation with survival
- Engineered features (family size, title) provide strong predictive signals

These insights guide our feature engineering strategy in the following sections.

This analysis reveals capable feature engineering opportunities that you'll demonstrate throughout this template.

**Industry Success Stories**

Leading companies demonstrate the significant power of efficient feature engineering. Netflix discovered that "time since last similar movie watched" predicts viewing behavior more accurately than simple genre categorization. Uber's pricing algorithms rely heavily on "ratio of supply to demand in area" rather than absolute numbers, while Amazon's recommendation engine leverages "purchase frequency in category" to outperform individual purchase-based features.

```python
# Example: Creating family and social features from Titanic datadef create_family_features(batch):
    """Engineer family and social features from Titanic dataset."""
    family_features = []
    for passenger in batch:
        # Calculate family size
        family_size = passenger['SibSp'] + passenger['Parch'] + 1
        
        # Extract title from name
        name = passenger.get('Name', '')
        title = 'Unknown'
        if 'Mr.' in name:
            title = 'Mr'
        elif 'Mrs.' in name:
            title = 'Mrs'
        elif 'Miss.' in name:
            title = 'Miss'
        elif 'Master.' in name:
            title = 'Master'
        elif 'Dr.' in name:
            title = 'Dr'
        
        # Create feature-engineered passenger record
        family_features = {
            'family_size': family_size,
            'is_alone': 1 if family_size == 1 else 0,
            'large_family': 1 if family_size > 4 else 0,
            'title': title,
            'is_child': 1 if passenger.get('Age', 999) < 16 else 0,
            'fare_per_person': passenger.get('Fare', 0) / max(family_size, 1)
        }
        
        family_features.append({**passenger, **family_data})
    
    return family_features

# Apply family feature engineering to Titanic datafamily_enhanced_data = dataset.map_batches(
    create_family_features,
    batch_format="pandas"
)

print("Family and social features created successfully")
print(f"Enhanced dataset size: {family_enhanced_data.count():,} passengers")
```

**The Feature Engineering Challenge at Scale**

Modern ML systems face large challenges in feature engineering. Scale becomes critical when datasets contain billions of rows and thousands of potential features, while complexity grows exponentially as interaction features create vast feature spaces. Performance bottlenecks often emerge in the feature engineering stage rather than model training, and poor feature quality consistently leads to poor models regardless of algorithm sophistication.

Automation becomes essential because manual feature engineering cannot scale to enterprise data volumes. E-commerce platforms must create 500+ features from customer behavior, product catalogs, and transaction histories. Financial services require 1000+ risk indicators from market data, credit histories, and economic factors. Healthcare organizations transform patient records, lab results, and imaging data into predictive features, while manufacturing companies convert sensor data, maintenance logs, and production metrics into quality predictors.

```python
# Example: Automated feature selection with large datasetsdef automated_feature_selection(dataset, target_column, max_features=100):
    """Automatically select the most predictive features."""
    
    # Calculate feature importance scores
    def calculate_feature_importance(batch):

    """Calculate Feature Importance."""
        # Simplified correlation-based feature scoring
        correlations = []
        for column in batch.columns:
            if column != target_column:
                correlation = abs(batch[column].corr(batch[target_column]))
                correlations.append((column, correlation))
        return correlations
    
    # Apply feature selection across distributed data
    feature_scores = dataset.map_batches(
        calculate_feature_importance,
        batch_format="pandas"
    )
    
    print(f"Automated feature selection identified top {max_features} features")
    return feature_scores

# Demonstrate automated feature selectionselected_features = automated_feature_selection(enhanced_data, 'target_variable')
```

**Example: Ray Data for automated feature engineering:**

```python
import ray
from ray.data.expressions import col, lit

# Load ML dataset
dataset = ray.data.read_csv("s3://ray-benchmark-data/ml-datasets/titanic.csv", num_cpus=0.05)

# Simple feature engineering with Ray Data native operations
# Create family size feature
dataset_with_features = dataset.add_column(
    "family_size",
    col("SibSp") + col("Parch") + lit(1)
)

# Create boolean features with expressions
dataset_with_features = dataset_with_features.add_column(
    "is_alone",
    col("family_size") == lit(1)
)

# Complex features with map_batches
def create_advanced_features(batch):
    """Create multiple features in one pass."""
    for record in batch:
        record['age_group'] = 'child' if record.get('Age', 0) < 18 else 'adult'
        record['fare_per_person'] = record.get('Fare', 0) / max(record.get('family_size', 1), 1)
    return batch

enriched_dataset = dataset_with_features.map_batches(
    create_advanced_features,
    batch_size=2000,
    concurrency=4
)

print(f"Created multiple features for {enriched_dataset.count():,} samples")
print("Ray Data benefits: efficient column operations, distributed processing")
```

## Step 1: Feature Engineering Setup

Initialize Ray Data and prepare for distributed feature engineering:

```python
import ray
from ray.data.expressions import col, lit
from ray.data.aggregate import Count, Mean, Sum

# Configure Ray Data for feature engineering
ctx = ray.data.DataContext.get_current()
ctx.enable_progress_bars = True
ctx.enable_operator_progress_bars = True

print("Ray Data configured for distributed feature engineering")
print(f"Cluster resources: {ray.cluster_resources()}")

# Display sample data to understand structure
print("\nTitanic Dataset Overview:")
print(f"  Total records: {dataset.count():,}")
print(f"  Schema fields: {list(dataset.schema().names)}")

# Show sample records
samples = dataset.take(3)
print("\nSample records:")
for i, sample in enumerate(samples, 1):
    print(f"  {i}. Age: {sample.get('Age')}, Pclass: {sample.get('Pclass')}, "
          f"Fare: {sample.get('Fare')}, Survived: {sample.get('Survived')}")
```

## Step 2: Categorical Feature Engineering with Ray Data

Categorical features are non-numeric values (gender, location, product category) that need special encoding for ML algorithms. This section demonstrates the most popular encoding techniques using Ray Data.

### Why Categorical Encoding Matters

Most ML algorithms require numerical input, but categorical features contain valuable information:
- **Sex** (male/female) strongly predicts survival - women and children first
- **Passenger Class** (1st/2nd/3rd) indicates socioeconomic status and survival priority
- **Embarked Port** (C/Q/S) correlates with passenger demographics

**Encoding approaches:**
- **One-hot encoding**: Create binary column for each category (best for low cardinality)
- **Label encoding**: Assign integer to each category (ordinal relationships)
- **Target encoding**: Replace with target variable mean (high cardinality)
- **Frequency encoding**: Replace with category frequency (simple but effective)

### Simple Feature Engineering with Ray Data Native Operations

```python
from ray.data.expressions import col, lit

# Step 1: Create family size feature using native add_column()
# Why: Family size is a strong survival predictor - families of 2-4 had best survival rates
print("Creating family size features...")

family_enhanced_data = dataset.add_column(
    "family_size",  # New feature name
    col("SibSp") + col("Parch") + lit(1)  # Siblings + Parents + Self = Family size
)

# Step 2: Create boolean features with expressions API
# Why: Being alone or in large family affects survival probability
family_enhanced_data = family_enhanced_data.add_column(
    "is_alone",  # Binary feature: 1 if traveling alone, 0 otherwise
    col("family_size") == lit(1)  # True becomes 1, False becomes 0
)

family_enhanced_data = family_enhanced_data.add_column(
    "large_family",  # Binary feature: 1 if family size > 4
    col("family_size") > lit(4)  # Families over 4 had lower survival rates
)

print(f"✓ Family features created: {family_enhanced_data.count():,} records")
print("  Ray Data benefits: No pandas conversion needed, efficient column operations")

# Step 3: One-hot encode categorical variables with map_batches
# Why: ML algorithms need numeric input - one-hot encoding creates binary features
def engineer_categorical_features(batch):
    """
    Create one-hot encoded features for categorical variables.
    
    One-hot encoding creates a binary column for each category value.
    Example: Sex becomes Sex_male=1, Sex_female=0 for male passengers
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        List of records with one-hot encoded features added
    """
    enhanced_records = []
    
    for record in batch:
        # Extract categorical values
        sex = record.get('Sex', 'unknown')
        embarked = record.get('Embarked', 'unknown')
        pclass = record.get('Pclass', 0)
        
        # Create new record with one-hot encoded features
        enhanced_record = {
            **record,  # Keep all original features
            
            # Sex one-hot encoding (2 categories)
            'Sex_male': 1 if sex == 'male' else 0,
            'Sex_female': 1 if sex == 'female' else 0,

            'Pclass_3': 1 if pclass == 3 else 0   # Third class
        }
        
        enhanced_records.append(enhanced_record)
    
    return enhanced_records

# Apply categorical encoding with optimized batch processing
# batch_size=2000: Process 2000 records per batch for efficiency
# concurrency=4: Run 4 parallel workers for distributed processing
categorical_features = family_enhanced_data.map_batches(
    engineer_categorical_features,
    batch_size=2000,  # Larger batches = better throughput
    concurrency=4      # Parallel processing across cluster
)

print(f"✓ Categorical features created: {categorical_features.count():,} records")
print(f"✓ Features per record: {len(categorical_features.take(1)[0])}")
print(f"✓ Original features: {len(dataset.schema().names)}")
print(f"✓ Added features: {len(categorical_features.take(1)[0]) - len(dataset.schema().names)}")
```

**Ray Data benefits demonstrated:**
- `add_column()` for efficient simple transformations
- Expressions API for conditional logic
- `map_batches()` for complex one-hot encoding
- Concurrency parameter for parallel processing

## Step 3: Numerical Feature Engineering

Numerical features can be transformed to capture non-linear relationships and improve model performance. This section demonstrates the most effective numerical transformations.

### Why Numerical Transformations Matter

Raw numerical features often have limitations:
- **Linear relationships**: ML models may miss non-linear patterns
- **Skewed distributions**: Extreme values dominate algorithms like gradient boosting
- **Scale differences**: Features with different ranges (Age: 0-80, Fare: 0-500) need normalization
- **Hidden patterns**: Interactions between features reveal important relationships

### Popular Numerical Transformations

```python
import numpy as np

def create_numerical_features(batch):
    """
    Create numerical features including polynomial, log, and interaction features.
    
    Transformations applied:
    - Polynomial: Capture non-linear relationships (Age²)
    - Logarithmic: Handle right-skewed distributions (log(Fare))
    - Square root: Moderate skewness
    - Interactions: Combine features (Age × Fare)
    - Ratios: Create relative metrics (Fare/Family)
    - Binning: Convert continuous to categorical groups
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        List of records with numerical features added
    """
    enhanced_records = []
    
    for record in batch:
        # Extract original numerical values
        age = record.get('Age', 0)
        fare = record.get('Fare', 0)
        family_size = record.get('family_size', 1)
        
        # Create enhanced record with all transformations
        enhanced_record = {
            **record,  # Keep all original features
            
            # Polynomial features - capture non-linear relationships
            # Why: Age² helps model that survival rate isn't linear with age
            'Age_squared': age ** 2 if age else 0,
            
            # Logarithmic features - handle skewed distributions
            # Why: Fare has long tail (most low, few very high) - log normalizes it
            'Fare_log': np.log(fare + 1) if fare > 0 else 0,  # +1 to handle fare=0
            
            # Square root features - moderate skewness
            # Why: Less aggressive than log for moderately skewed features
            'Fare_sqrt': np.sqrt(fare) if fare >= 0 else 0,
            
            # Interaction features - multiplicative relationships
            # Why: Wealthy older passengers may have different survival than young wealthy
            'Age_x_Fare': age * fare,
            
            # Ratio features - normalized comparisons
            # Why: $100 fare for family of 4 very different from $100 for solo traveler
            'Fare_per_family': fare / max(family_size, 1),  # Avoid division by zero
            
            # Binning - create categories from continuous features
            # Why: Models can learn different patterns for children, adults, seniors
            'Age_group': 'child' if age < 18 else 'adult' if age < 60 else 'senior',
            
            # Fare binning - group by price tier
            # Why: Fare correlates with class and survival, bins capture thresholds
            'Fare_level': 'low' if fare < 10 else 'medium' if fare < 50 else 'high'
        }
        
        enhanced_records.append(enhanced_record)
    
    return enhanced_records

# Display sample features to verify transformations
sample = numerical_features.take(1)[0]
print(f"✓ Example features: Age_squared={sample.get('Age_squared')}, "
      f"Fare_per_family={sample.get('Fare_per_family'):.2f}")
print(f"✓ Total features now: {len(numerical_features.schema().names)}")
```

### Numerical Feature Transformations

| Transformation | Purpose | Example | When to Use |
|----------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Polynomial** | Capture non-linear relationships | Age², Age³ | Non-linear patterns in data |
| **Logarithmic** | Handle skewed distributions | log(Fare) | Income, prices, counts |
| **Square Root** | Moderate skewness | √Fare | Moderate right-skewed data |
| **Binning** | Create categorical from numeric | Age groups | Capture thresholds |
| **Scaling** | Normalize ranges | StandardScaler | Neural networks, distance-based algos |
| **Interactions** | Combine features | Age × Fare | Multiplicative relationships |
| **Ratios** | Relative values | Fare/FamilySize | Normalized comparisons |

## Step 4: Advanced Feature Engineering

### Interaction and Aggregation Features

Create features that combine multiple columns:

```python
def create_interaction_features(batch):
    """Create cross-feature interactions for ML."""
    enhanced_records = []
    
    for record in batch:
        age = record.get('Age', 0)
        fare = record.get('Fare', 0)
        pclass = record.get('Pclass', 3)
        family_size = record.get('family_size', 1)
        
        # Create interaction features
        enhanced_record = {
            **record,
            # Class-based interactions
            'Fare_per_class': fare / max(pclass, 1),
            'Age_class_interaction': age * pclass,
            
            # Family-based interactions
            'Total_family_fare': fare * family_size,
            'Is_traveling_alone': 1 if family_size == 1 else 0,
            
            # Combined risk score
            'Survival_score': (
                (1 if pclass == 1 else 0.5 if pclass == 2 else 0.2) *
                (1 if family_size in [2, 3, 4] else 0.5) *
                (1 if fare > 30 else 0.7)
            )
        }
        
        enhanced_records.append(enhanced_record)
    
    return enhanced_records

# Apply interaction feature engineering
interaction_features = numerical_features.map_batches(
    create_interaction_features,
    batch_size=2000,
    concurrency=4
)

print(f"✓ Interaction features created: {interaction_features.count():,} records")
```

### Target Encoding for Categorical Features

**What is target encoding?** Replace each category with the mean of the target variable for that category.

**Why use it?**
- **High-cardinality categoricals**: When you have 100+ unique values (zip codes, customer IDs)
- **Captures relationship**: Directly encodes correlation between category and target
- **Reduces dimensionality**: One column instead of 100 one-hot columns

**Example:** If Embarked='C' passengers had 55% survival rate, replace 'C' with 0.55

**Caution:** Can cause target leakage - use with cross-validation or separate training/validation encoding

```python
def create_target_encoding(batch):
    """
    Create target encoding features using category means.
    
    Target encoding replaces categorical values with the mean target value
    for that category. This captures the relationship between the category
    and the target variable in a single numerical feature.
    
    Example:
        Embarked='C' with 55% survival → Embarked_target_enc=0.55
        Embarked='S' with 34% survival → Embarked_target_enc=0.34

        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        Batch with target encoding features added
    """
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    # Calculate mean survival rate by Embarked port
    # This gives us the "target encoding" for each port
    if 'Embarked' in df.columns and 'Survived' in df.columns:

print(f"✓ Target encoding applied: {target_encoded.count():,} records")
print("✓ Benefit: High-cardinality categories now numerical without dimension explosion")
```

### Frequency and Count Encoding

**What is frequency encoding?** Replace each category with how often it appears in the dataset.

**Why use it?**
- **Simple but effective**: Often performs as well as complex encodings
- **Captures category importance**: Frequent categories might be more significant
- **No target leakage**: Safe to use without cross-validation concerns
- **Works with high cardinality**: One number per category regardless of unique values

**Example:** If 'Cabin=B5' appears in 2% of records, encode as 0.02

```python
def create_frequency_encoding(batch):
    """
    Create frequency encoding for categorical features.
    
    Frequency encoding replaces each category with its occurrence frequency.
    This captures how common or rare each category is in the dataset.
    
    Benefits:
    - Simple one-number encoding regardless of cardinality
    - No dummy variable explosion
    - Captures category importance via frequency
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        Batch with frequency encoding features added
    """
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    # Calculate normalized frequencies (0.0 to 1.0)
    if 'Cabin' in df.columns:
        cabin_freq = df['Cabin'].value_counts(normalize=True).to_dict()
        
        # Apply frequency encoding to each record
        for record in batch:
            cabin = record.get('Cabin', 'unknown')
            # Replace cabin value with its frequency in dataset
            record['Cabin_frequency'] = cabin_freq.get(cabin, 0.0)
    
    return batch

# Apply frequency encoding using Ray Data  
freq_encoded = target_encoded.map_batches(
    create_frequency_encoding,

    concurrency=2      # Moderate concurrency
)

print(f"✓ Frequency encoding applied: {freq_encoded.count():,} records")
print("✓ Cabin categories encoded by frequency - rare cabins have low scores")
```

### Missing Value Indicator Features

**Why create missing value indicators?** Missing data patterns can be predictive themselves.

**Key insight:** The fact that data is missing can signal something important:
- **Missing age**: Might indicate lower-class passengers with incomplete records
- **Missing cabin**: Might indicate cheaper tickets without cabin assignments
- **Systematic missingness**: Certain passenger groups might have more missing data

**ML benefit:** Instead of just imputing missing values, preserve the signal by creating indicator features.

```python
def create_missing_indicators(batch):
    """
    Create binary indicators for missing values.
    
    Missing data patterns can be predictive. For example, passengers without
    cabin information might have had cheaper tickets and lower survival rates.
    
    This function creates:
    - Binary flag for each field's missingness (Age_is_missing, Cabin_is_missing)
    - Total count of missing values per record
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        List of records with missing indicator features added
    """
    enhanced_records = []
    
    # Fields to check for missingness
    # These fields have missing patterns that correlate with survival
    check_fields = ['Age', 'Cabin', 'Embarked', 'Fare']
    
    for record in batch:
        enhanced_record = record.copy()
        
        # Create binary indicator for each field's missingness
        for field in check_fields:
            # 1 if missing, 0 if present
            enhanced_record[f'{field}_is_missing'] = 1 if record.get(field) is None else 0
        
        # Count total missing values - captures data quality per record
        # Why: Records with many missing values might represent data quality issues
        enhanced_record['total_missing'] = sum(
            1 for field in check_fields if record.get(field) is None
        )
        
        enhanced_records.append(enhanced_record)
    
    return enhanced_records

# Apply missing indicators using Ray Data distributed processing
with_missing_features = freq_encoded.map_batches(
    create_missing_indicators,
    batch_size=2000,  # Efficient batch size
    concurrency=4      # High concurrency - this is a fast operation
)

print(f"✓ Missing indicators created: {with_missing_features.count():,} records")
print("✓ Missingness patterns now available as ML features")
```

### Aggregation Features Using Ray Data groupby

**What are aggregation features?** Calculate group statistics and join them back to individual records.

**Why use aggregations?**
- **Capture group patterns**: Average fare for your passenger class
- **Relative comparisons**: How you compare to your group (above/below average)
- **Encode relationships**: Group membership without creating many columns

**Example:** Add "average age for my passenger class" as a feature for each passenger

**Ray Data advantage:** Native `groupby().aggregate()` operations distribute group calculations across cluster.

```python
from ray.data.aggregate import Count, Mean, Max, Min, Std

# Calculate aggregated features by passenger class using Ray Data native operations
# Why: Comparing yourself to your group is often more predictive than absolute values
print("Creating aggregation features using Ray Data native operations...")

# Step 1: Calculate group statistics
# This distributes the aggregation across your Ray cluster
pclass_stats = with_missing_features.groupby('Pclass').aggregate(
    Count(),          # Number of passengers in each class
    Mean('Fare'),     # Average fare for each class
    Max('Fare'),      # Maximum fare paid in each class
    Std('Age')        # Age variability within each class
)

print("Aggregated Statistics by Class:")
print(pclass_stats.limit(10).to_pandas())

# Step 2: Join aggregated stats back to main dataset
# Now each passenger has their class statistics as features
# Example: A 1st class passenger gets mean_fare_class1 = $84.15
with_agg_features = with_missing_features.join(
    pclass_stats,
    left_key='Pclass',    # Join on passenger class
    right_key='Pclass'     # Broadcast group stats to all members
)

print(f"✓ Aggregation features added: {with_agg_features.count():,} records")
print("✓ Each passenger now has their group's statistics as features")

# Verify the new features
sample = with_agg_features.take(1)[0]
print(f"✓ Example: Passenger in class {sample.get('Pclass')} has "
      f"class mean fare = ${sample.get('mean(Fare)', 0):.2f}")
```

### Cyclical/Temporal Feature Encoding

Encode cyclical features (months, days, hours) using sine/cosine:

```python
import numpy as np

def create_cyclical_features(batch):
    """Create cyclical encoding for periodic features."""
    enhanced_records = []
    
    for record in batch:
        # Example: If we had a month field
        # Encode it cyclically so December (12) is close to January (1)
        enhanced_record = record.copy()
        
        # Simulated month feature for demonstration
        pclass = record.get('Pclass', 1)
        
        # Cyclical encoding (works for any periodic feature)
        enhanced_record['Pclass_sin'] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * pclass / 3)
        enhanced_record['Pclass_cos'] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * pclass / 3)
        
        enhanced_records.append(enhanced_record)
    
    return enhanced_records

# Apply cyclical encoding
cyclical_features = with_agg_features.map_batches(
    create_cyclical_features,
    batch_size=2000,
    concurrency=4
)

print(f"✓ Cyclical features created: {cyclical_features.count():,} records")
```

### Text Feature Engineering

**Why extract features from text?** Text columns often contain hidden structured information.

**Passenger names example:**
- **Name**: "Braund, Mr. Owen Harris" contains:
  - Title: "Mr." (indicates male adult)
  - Format: "LastName, Title FirstName" (standard format)
  - Length: Longer names might indicate nobility or importance

**Common text feature engineering techniques:**
1. **Pattern extraction**: Extract titles, prefixes, suffixes using regex
2. **Text statistics**: Length, word count, character counts
3. **Text indicators**: Presence of keywords, parentheses, special characters
4. **NLP features**: Sentiment, entities, topics (for longer text)

```python
def create_text_features(batch):
    """
    Create features from text fields like passenger names.
    
    Text columns often contain structured information that can be extracted:
    - Titles (Mr., Mrs., Dr.) indicate social status and demographics
    - Name length might correlate with social class
    - Special characters might indicate nicknames or maiden names
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        List of records with text features added
    """
    enhanced_records = []
    
    for record in batch:
        name = record.get('Name', '')
        
        # Extract title from name using pattern matching
        # Why: Titles strongly correlate with survival (Mrs/Miss higher than Mr)
        title = 'Unknown'
        if 'Mr.' in name:
            title = 'Mr'        # Adult male
        elif 'Mrs.' in name:
            title = 'Mrs'       # Married woman - higher survival
        elif 'Miss.' in name:
            title = 'Miss'      # Unmarried woman - higher survival
        elif 'Master.' in name:
            title = 'Master'    # Young boy - higher survival
        elif any(t in name for t in ['Dr.', 'Rev.', 'Col.', 'Major']):
            title = 'Professional'  # Higher social status
        
        enhanced_record = {
            **record,
            
            # Title extraction - categorical feature
            'Title': title,
            
            # Title one-hot encoding - binary features
            'Title_Mr': 1 if title == 'Mr' else 0,
            'Title_Mrs': 1 if title == 'Mrs' else 0,
            'Title_Miss': 1 if title == 'Miss' else 0,
            
            # Text statistics - numerical features
            'Name_length': len(name),              # Longer names might indicate nobility
            'Name_word_count': len(name.split()),  # Complex names might indicate status
            
            # Text indicators - binary features
            'Has_parentheses': 1 if '(' in name else 0  # Parentheses often indicate maiden names or nicknames
        }
        
        enhanced_records.append(enhanced_record)
    
    return enhanced_records

# Apply text feature engineering using Ray Data
# This demonstrates how to extract structured information from unstructured text
text_features = cyclical_features.map_batches(
    create_text_features,
    batch_size=2000,  # Standard batch size
    concurrency=4      # High concurrency - text operations are fast
)

print(f"✓ Text features extracted: {text_features.count():,} records")
print("✓ Extracted titles correlate with survival rates (Mrs/Miss higher than Mr)")
```

### Ranking and Percentile Features

**Why use ranking features?** Convert absolute values to relative rankings within the dataset.

**Benefits:**
- **Robust to outliers**: Ranks aren't affected by extreme values
- **Normalized scale**: Percentiles always 0-1 regardless of original range
- **Interpretable**: 90th percentile means "better than 90% of dataset"
- **Works with skewed data**: Doesn't require normal distribution

**Example:** Instead of "Fare=$100", use "Fare at 85th percentile" (top 15% of fares)

**Use cases:**
- Ranking customers by purchase amount
- Percentile features for age, income, scores
- Relative metrics more stable than absolute values

```python
def add_ranking_features(batch):
    """
    Create percentile and ranking features.
    
    Ranking converts absolute values to relative position in dataset.
    This is useful when the relative position is more important than
    the absolute value (e.g., being in top 10% vs specific amount).
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        Batch with ranking/percentile features added
    """
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    # Calculate percentile ranks for fare
    # Why: 90th percentile fare more meaningful than absolute $100 fare
    if 'Fare' in df.columns:
        df['Fare_percentile'] = df['Fare'].rank(pct=True)  # 0.0 to 1.0
        df['Fare_rank'] = df['Fare'].rank()                 # 1 to N
    
    # Calculate percentile ranks for age
    # Why: Age percentile captures relative maturity
    if 'Age' in df.columns:
        df['Age_percentile'] = df['Age'].rank(pct=True)
    
    return df.to_dict('records')

# Apply ranking features using Ray Data
# Note: This uses pandas rank() within batches, so rankings are approximate
ranked_features = text_features.map_batches(
    add_ranking_features,
    batch_size=2000,  # Larger batches give better ranking estimates
    concurrency=2      # Moderate concurrency for ranking operations
)

print(f"✓ Ranking features created: {ranked_features.count():,} records")
print("✓ Fare and Age now have percentile features (0-1 scale)")
```

### Feature Scaling and Normalization

**Why scale features?** Many ML algorithms are sensitive to feature scale differences.

**Algorithms that need scaling:**
- **Neural networks**: Gradient descent converges faster with scaled features
- **SVM**: Distance-based algorithms affected by scale
- **K-means clustering**: Euclidean distance dominated by large-scale features
- **Linear regression with regularization**: Regularization penalizes based on scale

**Algorithms that don't need scaling:**
- **Tree-based**: Decision trees, Random Forest, XGBoost (split on thresholds)

**Common scaling methods:**
1. **Min-Max Scaling**: Scale to [0, 1] range
2. **Standard Scaling**: Mean=0, Std=1 (assumes normal distribution)
3. **Robust Scaling**: Uses median and IQR (robust to outliers)

```python
def apply_feature_scaling(batch):
    """
    Apply min-max scaling to numerical features.
    
    Min-max scaling transforms features to [0, 1] range:
        scaled = (value - min) / (max - min)
    
    Why use it:
    - Neural networks train faster with normalized inputs
    - Features on different scales don't dominate
    - Gradients are more stable during training
    
    Args:
        batch: List of records from Ray Data
        
    Returns:
        Batch with scaled features added
    """
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    # Features to scale - numerical features with different ranges
    numeric_cols = ['Age', 'Fare', 'family_size']
    
    for col in numeric_cols:
        if col in df.columns:
            # Calculate min and max for this batch
            col_min = df[col].min()
            col_max = df[col].max()
            
            # Apply min-max scaling: (value - min) / (max - min)
            if col_max > col_min:
                df[f'{col}_scaled'] = (df[col] - col_min) / (col_max - col_min)
            else:
                # If all values same, set to 0
                df[f'{col}_scaled'] = 0
    
    return df.to_dict('records')

# Apply scaling using Ray Data distributed processing
scaled_features = ranked_features.map_batches(
    apply_feature_scaling,
    batch_size=2000,  # Larger batches for better min/max estimates
    concurrency=4      # High concurrency - scaling is fast
)

print(f"✓ Feature scaling applied: {scaled_features.count():,} records")
print("✓ Age, Fare, and family_size now scaled to [0, 1] range")

## Step 5: Feature Selection with Ray Data

Use Ray Data aggregations for statistical feature selection:

```python
from ray.data.aggregate import Count, Mean, Std

# Calculate feature statistics using Ray Data native aggregations
print("Calculating feature importance using Ray Data aggregations...")

# Example: Calculate correlation-based importance
def calculate_feature_stats(dataset):
    """Calculate statistical metrics for feature selection."""
    
    # Get numeric features
    sample = dataset.take(100)
    numeric_fields = ['Age', 'Fare', 'family_size', 'Age_squared', 'Fare_log']
    
    feature_stats = {}
    for field in numeric_fields:
        try:
            stats = dataset.aggregate(
                Count(),
                Mean(field),
                Std(field)
            )
            feature_stats[field] = {
                'count': stats['count()'],
                'mean': stats[f'mean({field})'],
                'std': stats[f'std({field})']
            }
        except:
            continue
    
    return feature_stats

# Calculate feature statistics
feature_importance = calculate_feature_stats(interaction_features)

print("Feature Statistics:")
for feature, stats in list(feature_importance.items())[:5]:
    print(f"  {feature}: mean={stats['mean']:.2f}, std={stats['std']:.2f}")

# Select high-variance features using Ray Data filter
high_variance_threshold = 0.1

# Use expressions API to select features based on statistics
final_features = interaction_features.select_columns([
    'Survived', 'Age', 'Fare', 'Pclass', 'family_size',
    'Sex_male', 'Sex_female', 'Embarked_S', 'Embarked_C',
    'Age_squared', 'Fare_log', 'Fare_per_family',
    'Is_traveling_alone', 'Survival_score'
])

print(f"✓ Selected {len(final_features.schema().names)} features for ML training")
```

## Advanced Features

### Automated Feature Engineering

Ray Data enables automated feature generation and discovery:

```python
# Example: Automated interaction feature generation
def generate_interaction_features(batch):
    """Automatically generate interaction features between numeric columns."""
    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    numeric_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=['number']).columns[:5]
    
    # Generate multiplicative interactions
    for i, col1 in enumerate(numeric_cols):
        for col2 in numeric_cols[i+1:]:
            df[f'{col1}_x_{col2}'] = df[col1] * df[col2]
            df[f'{col1}_div_{col2}'] = df[col1] / (df[col2] + 1e-6)
    
    return df.to_dict('records')

# Apply automated feature generation
auto_features = dataset.map_batches(
    generate_interaction_features,
    batch_size=1000,
    concurrency=4
)

print(f"Automated feature generation created {len(auto_features.take(1)[0])} total features")
```

**Key capabilities:**
- Genetic programming for feature creation
- Automated feature interaction discovery
- Domain-specific feature templates
- Feature engineering optimization

### GPU Acceleration

For large-scale feature engineering, use cuDF for GPU acceleration:

```python
# Example: GPU-accelerated feature engineering with cuDF
def gpu_feature_engineering(batch):
    """Feature engineering with GPU acceleration using cuDF."""
    import cudf as pd  # GPU-accelerated pandas
    
    df = pd.DataFrame(batch)
    
    # These operations run on GPU
    df['log_amount'] = df['amount'].log()
    df['amount_squared'] = df['amount'] ** 2
    df['normalized_amount'] = (df['amount'] - df['amount'].mean()) / df['amount'].std()
    
    return df.to_dict('records')

# Apply GPU-accelerated features (requires GPU cluster)
gpu_features = dataset.map_batches(
    gpu_feature_engineering,
    batch_size=5000,
    num_gpus=0.5,  # Allocate GPU resources
    concurrency=2
)

print("GPU-accelerated feature engineering complete")
```

**GPU acceleration benefits:**
- CUDA-accelerated feature transformations
- Parallel feature computation across GPUs
- Memory-efficient feature processing
- GPU-optimized algorithms

### Feature Store Integration

Integrate engineered features with ML feature stores:

```python
# Example: Export features to feature store format
def prepare_feature_store_export(batch):
    """Format features for feature store ingestion."""
    feature_records = []
    
    for record in batch:
        feature_record = {
            'entity_id': record.get('customer_id'),
            'timestamp': record.get('feature_timestamp'),
            'features': {
                'family_size': record.get('family_size'),
                'fare_per_person': record.get('fare_per_person'),
                'age_group': record.get('age_group')
            }
        }
        feature_records.append(feature_record)
    
    return feature_records

# Export to feature store format
feature_store_data = enriched_dataset.map_batches(
    prepare_feature_store_export,
    batch_size=2000

## Production Considerations

### Feature Pipeline Management

```python
# Example: Feature pipeline with monitoring and validation
def validated_feature_pipeline(dataset):
    """Production feature pipeline with quality checks."""
    
    # Step 1: Create features
    features = dataset.add_column("family_size", col("SibSp") + col("Parch") + lit(1))
    
    # Step 2: Validate feature quality
    sample = features.take(100)
    if all(r.get('family_size') is not None for r in sample):
        print("✓ Feature quality validation passed")
    else:
        print("✗ Feature quality issues detected")
    
    # Step 3: Monitor feature statistics
    stats = features.aggregate(
        Count(),
        Mean('family_size'),
        Max('family_size')
    )
    print(f"Feature stats: {stats}")
    
    return features

# Run monitored pipeline
production_features = validated_feature_pipeline(dataset)
```

# Step 2: Engineer behavioral features
customer_features = customers.add_column(
    "account_age_days",
    col("current_date") - col("signup_date")
)

# Step 3: Create aggregated transaction features
transaction_stats = transactions.groupby("customer_id").aggregate(
    Count(),

)

# Step 4: Join customer and transaction features
ml_ready = customer_features.join(
    transaction_stats,
    left_key="customer_id",
    right_key="customer_id"
)

# Step 5: Select features and prepare for training
final_features = ml_ready.select_columns([
    "customer_id", "account_age_days", "count()", 
    "mean(amount)", "sum(amount)", "churn_label"
])

print(f"ML-ready dataset: {final_features.count():,} customers with engineered features")

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "memory Errors During Feature Creation"
**Solution**:
```python
# Reduce batch size for memory-intensive feature engineeringdataset.map_batches(feature_function, batch_size=1000, concurrency=2, batch_format="pandas")
```

### Problem: "features Have Nan or Infinite Values"
**Solution**:
```python
# Add validation and cleaning for feature valuesdef clean_features(features):

    """Clean Features."""
    return np.nan_to_num(features, nan=0.0, posinf=1e6, neginf=-1e6)
```

### Problem: "feature Selection Takes Too Long"
**Solution**:
```python
# Use correlation-based pre-filtering before statistical testshigh_corr_features = df.corr().abs().sum().nlargest(100).index
```

### Problem: "categorical Encoding Creates Too Many Features"
**Solution**:
```python
# Limit high-cardinality categorical featuresdef limit_categories(series, max_categories=20):
    top_categories = series.value_counts().head(max_categories).index
    return series.where(series.isin(top_categories), 'Other')
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Feature Caching**: Cache expensive feature calculations for reuse
2. **Parallel Processing**: Use Ray's parallelization for independent features
3. **Memory Management**: Process features in chunks for large datasets
4. **Data Types**: Use appropriate data types to minimize memory usage
5. **Feature Pruning**: Remove redundant features early in the pipeline

### Performance Considerations

Ray Data provides several advantages for feature engineering:
- **Parallel computation**: Feature calculations are distributed across multiple workers
