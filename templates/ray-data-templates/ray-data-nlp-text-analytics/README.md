## Template Parts

This template is split into two parts for better learning progression:

| Part | Description | Time | File |
|------|-------------|------|------|
| **Part 1** | Text Processing Fundamentals | 15 min | [01-text-processing-fundamentals.md](01-text-processing-fundamentals.md) |
| **Part 2** | NLP Analysis and Insights | 15 min | [02-nlp-analysis-insights.md](02-nlp-analysis-insights.md) |

## What You'll Learn

### Part 1: Text Processing Fundamentals
Learn the basics of distributed text processing:
- **Text Data Loading**: Load text data from various sources with Ray Data
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean, tokenize, and normalize text at scale
- **Quick Start**: Get results in 5 minutes with real text data
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Word clouds and text analytics dashboards

### Part 2: NLP Analysis and Insights
Master advanced NLP techniques:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Distributed sentiment classification
- **Topic Modeling**: Discover topics in large text corpora
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Extract entities from text
- **Production Deployment**: Scale NLP to enterprise workloads

## Learning Objectives

**Why text processing matters**: Memory and computation challenges with large text datasets require distributed processing solutions.

**Ray Data's text capabilities**: Distribute NLP tasks across multiple workers for text analytics.

**Real-world text applications**: Techniques used by companies to process reviews, comments, and documents.

## Overview

**Challenge**: Processing large text datasets exceeds single-machine capabilities:
- **Volume**: 100M+ social media posts, product reviews, or documents
- **Memory**: Text data with embeddings requires TB of RAM
- **Velocity**: Real-time sentiment analysis for customer feedback
- **NLP compute**: Transformer models require GPU acceleration

**Solution**: Ray Data enables distributed NLP at production scale:

| NLP Task | Traditional Approach | Ray Data Approach | Text Analytics Benefit |
|----------|---------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Text Preprocessing** | Sequential string operations | Parallel `map_batches()` | Process millions of documents |
| **Sentiment Analysis** | Batch API calls | Distributed model inference | Real-time insights from reviews |
| **Topic Modeling** | Single-machine LDA | Distributed text clustering with `groupby()` | Discover topics in TB of text |
| **Entity Extraction** | Sequential NER | Parallel transformer inference | Extract entities from all documents |

:::tip Ray Data for NLP Workloads
Text analytics is perfectly suited for Ray Data because:
- **Text preprocessing**: `map_batches()` parallelizes cleaning, tokenization, and normalization
- **Transformer inference**: Stateful actors load models once, process millions of texts
- **Embeddings generation**: Distribute embedding calculations across GPUs
- **Text aggregation**: `groupby()` for topic clustering and document grouping
- **Memory efficiency**: Stream processing handles unlimited text volumes
:::

**Real-world Impact**:
- **E-commerce**: Amazon analyzes 200M+ product reviews using distributed sentiment analysis
- **Social Media**: Twitter processes 500M+ daily tweets for trending topics using distributed NLP
- **News**: Bloomberg analyzes 100,000+ articles daily for financial sentiment using scalable pipelines
- **Customer Support**: Zendesk routes 10M+ support tickets using distributed text classification
