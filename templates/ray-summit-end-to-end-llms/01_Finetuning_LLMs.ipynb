    "\n",
    "The main usecase for finetuning LLMs is to adapt a pre-trained model to a specific task or dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task-Specific Performance**: Fine-tuning hones an LLM's capabilities for a particular task, leading to superior performance.\n",
    "- **Resource Efficiency**: We can use smaller LLMs that require less computational resources to achieve better performance than larger general-purpose models.\n",
    "- **Privacy and Security**: We can self-host finetuned models to ensure that our data is not shared with third parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide, we will be finetuning an LLM model on a custom video gaming dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The task is a functional representation task where we want to extract structured data from user input on video games."
