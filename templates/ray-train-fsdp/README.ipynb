    "This template shows you how to unlock the memory and performance improvements of integrating PyTorch's Fully Sharded Data Parallel with Ray Train. \n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch's Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP2) enables model sharding across nodes, allowing distributed training of large models with a significantly smaller memory footprint compared to standard Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). For a more detailed overview of FSDP2, see [PyTorch's official documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html#getting-started-with-fully-sharded-data-parallel-fsdp2). \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on integrating PyTorch FSDP2 with Ray Train. Specifically, this guide covers: \n",
    "\n",
    "- A hands-on example of training an image classification model\n",
    "- Model checkpoint saving and loading with PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint (DCP)\n",
    "- Configuring FSDP2 to mitigate out-of-memory (OOM) errors using mixed precision, CPU offloading, sharding granularity, and more\n",
    "- GPU memory profiling with PyTorch Profiler\n",
    "- Loading a distributed model for inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook uses FSDP2's `fully_sharded` API. If you are currently using FSDP1's `FullyShardedDataParallel`, consider migrating to FSDP2 for improved performance and features such as lower memory usage and `DTensor` integration. "

    "## Example Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "For demonstration purposes, we will integrate Ray Train with FSDP2 using a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** trained on the FashionMNIST dataset. We chose ViT because it has clear, repeatable block structures (transformer blocks) that are ideal for demonstrating FSDP2's sharding capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is a relatively simple example, FSDP's complexity can lead to common challenges during training, such as out-of-memory (OOM) errors. Throughout this guide, we'll address these common issues by providing practical tips for improving performance and reducing memory utilization based on your specific use case. "

Experiment with different sharding granularities to find the optimal balance for your use case. In this demo, we shard only the encoder blocks—the largest layers in the Vision Transformer.\n",

    "\n",
    "**How CPU offloading works:**\n",
    "- Sharded parameters, gradients, and optimizer states are stored on CPU\n",
    "- Sharded parameters are copied to GPU during forward/backward computation and freed after use\n",
    "- Computed gradients are copied to the CPU where the optimizer step is computed\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use CPU offloading:**\n",
    "- When GPU memory is constrained\n",
    "- For very large models that don't fit in GPU memory\n",
    "\n",
    "**When not to use CPU offloading:**\n",
    "- When CPU memory is limited (can cause CPU crashes)\n",
    "- When training speed is more important than memory usage\n",

    "### 3b. `reshard_after_forward`  \n",
    "`fully_shard` has an `reshard_after_forward` flag that enables all-gathered model weights to be freed immediately after the forward pass. This reduces peak GPU memory usage but increases the communication overhead between workers during the backward pass as parameters need to be all-gathered again. If unsharded model parameters are able to completely fit on each worker and do not pose a memory bottleneck, there is no need to enable `reshard_after_forward`.\n",

This difference is not significant as we are using a small model where the activations are much larger than the model parmeters. The memory savings are more noticeable in settings with larger models. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3c. Mixed Precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Enabling mixed precision accelerates training and reduces GPU memory usage with minimal accuracy impact. Unlike other distributed approaches like DDP, FSDP2 already maintains high-precision copies of sharded parameters, so mixed precision requires no additional memory overhead. It is also important to note that in this demo, we use PyTorch's `float16` dtype for lower precision computation because we are utilizing older T4 GPUs that do not support the more stable `bfloat16` dtype. `bfloat16` is the more stable option over `float16` as its wider dynamic range avoids the need to ensure loss and gradient values are properly scaled in cases of underflow or overflow.\n",
