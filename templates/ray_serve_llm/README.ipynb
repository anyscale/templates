    "# Deploy LLMs with Ray Serve on Anyscale\n",
    "\n",
    "**⏱️ Time to complete**: 10 min\n",
    "\n",
    "This template comes with a library for serving OSS LLMs on Anyscale called [Ray Serve LLM](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/serving-llms.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Serve LLM provides a number of features that simplifies LLM development, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An extensive suite of pre-configured open source LLMs.\n",
    "- An OpenAI-compatible REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Serve LLM also provides the following operational features to efficiently scale LLM apps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Optimizations such as continuous batching, quantization and streaming.\n",
    "- Production-grade autoscaling support, including scale-to-zero.\n",
    "- Native multi-GPU and multi-node model deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This template explains how to set up, run, and query LLMs with Ray Serve LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about Ray Serve LLM, see [the docs](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/serve/llm/serving-llms.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: This guide is hosted within an Anyscale workspace, which provides easy access to compute resources. See the [Introduction to Workspaces](https://docs.anyscale.com/examples/intro-workspaces/) template for more details."

    "## Step 1 - Generate an LLM config\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray Serve LLM takes in a config that specifies the model you wish to serve, as well as its settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the Ray Serve LLM CLI in the workspace terminal to generate the config:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m ray.serve.llm.gen_config\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This command requires interactive inputs. You should execute it directly in the terminal, not within a Jupyter notebook cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command lets you pick from a common set of OSS LLMs and helps you configure them. You can tune settings like GPU type, tensor parallelism, and autoscaling parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you're configuring a model whose architecture is different from the provided list of models, you should closely review the generated model config file to provide the correct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "This command generates two files: an LLM config file, saved in `model_config/`, and a Ray Serve config file, `serve_TIMESTAMP.yaml`, that you can reference and re-run in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read and check how the generated model config looks like. Refer to  [vLLM Engine Config](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/engine_args.html) to further customize.\n"
