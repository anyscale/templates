# Quickstart: Stable diffusion pre-training

<img src="https://anyscale-materials.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/stable-diffusion/end_to_end_architecture_v6.jpeg" width="1000px">

Above is the reference architecture for Stable Diffusion pre-training with Ray and Anyscale. You can view how to implement the architecture by checking the provided python scripts. You can run interactive notebooks to guide you through the major steps in the process.

Here's what you can achieve with this reference implementation:

* Pre-train the Stable Diffusion v2 model on a massive dataset of ~2 billion images for less than $40,000.
* Eliminate preprocessing bottlenecks with Ray Data and improve training throughput by 30%.
* Benefit from system and algorithm optimizations to reduce training costs by 3x compared to baseline methods.
