This structure is ideal for teaching the model sophisticated tool-use behavior. To maintain role alignment in ShareGPT format, you must follow a strict turn order: `human` and `observation` (tool output) must appear in odd-numbered positions, while `gpt` and `function_call` must appear in even-numbered positions.
