    "   - Detached actors: synchronous registration (prevents name conflicts)\n",
    "   - Non-detached actors: asynchronous registration (better performance)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scheduling**: Once dependencies are resolved, the GCS schedules the actor creation task using the distributed scheduling protocol (same as normal tasks)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Buffering**: The creator can immediately submit method calls on the actor handle\n",
    "   - Tasks are buffered locally until the actor is created\n",
    "   - Handles can be passed to other tasks/actors before creation completes\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Notification**: When the actor is created, the GCS notifies all handle holders via pub-sub\n",
    "   - Each handle caches the actor's RPC address\n",
    "   - Buffered tasks are sent to the actor for execution\n",
