Business Use Case: Enterprise Document Intelligence Pipeline with Ray Data

This demo showcases a real-world business scenario where a financial services company
needs to process thousands of unstructured documents (PDFs, HTML reports, Word docs)
to extract insights, classify content, and generate summaries for compliance and analysis.

BUSINESS PROBLEM:
- Company receives 1000+ documents daily from various sources (regulatory filings, 
  client reports, market analysis, legal documents)
- Manual processing is expensive ($50-100 per document) and error-prone
- Need to extract structured data for compliance reporting and risk analysis
- Must process documents in real-time for regulatory deadlines
- Current solution takes 8+ hours and costs $50K+ monthly

RAY DATA SOLUTION:
- Processes 1000 documents in under 2 hours (4x faster than traditional methods)
- Reduces processing costs by 80% through automation
- Provides scalable, fault-tolerant processing with built-in error handling
- Integrates LLM inference directly in the data pipeline for intelligent analysis
- Outputs structured data ready for business intelligence tools

This demonstrates how Ray Data solves common enterprise challenges:
1. Scalable processing of diverse document formats
2. Intelligent content extraction and classification
3. Batch LLM inference for document understanding
4. Fault-tolerant processing with automatic retries
5. Structured output for downstream analytics

DOCUMENT PROCESSING PIPELINE OVERVIEW:

This cell implements the core document processing logic that transforms raw binary files
into structured, business-ready data. The pipeline handles multiple document formats
and extracts business-relevant metadata for downstream analysis.

Key Features:
- Multi-format support (PDF, Word, PowerPoint, HTML, Text)
- Business document classification and prioritization
- Intelligent text extraction with business context
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Metadata enrichment for compliance and risk analysis

Processing Flow:
1. File validation and type checking
2. Business classification based on filename patterns
3. Priority determination for processing order
4. Format-specific text extraction
5. Metadata enrichment and validation

"""
TEXT CHUNKING PIPELINE OVERVIEW:

This cell implements intelligent text chunking that prepares documents for LLM processing
while preserving business context and meaning. The chunking strategy ensures that:

1. Text chunks fit within LLM token limits
2. Business context is preserved across chunk boundaries
3. Overlapping chunks maintain continuity for analysis
4. Metadata is properly propagated to each chunk
5. Chunking is optimized for financial services content

Chunking Strategy:
- Default chunk size: 1000 characters (configurable)
- Overlap: 100 characters to maintain context
- Business-aware boundaries (respects sentence/paragraph breaks)
- Metadata preservation for compliance tracking

"""
IMPORTANT: vLLM Version Requirement

This demo requires vLLM version 0.7.2 for compatibility with Ray Data LLM package.
Install with: pip install vllm==0.7.2

Later versions may work but are not tested yet.
"""

"""
Production Deployment Notes:

1. **Ray Data LLM Package Integration**:
   - Replace the simulated LLM processing with actual Ray Data LLM package calls
   - Configure vLLM parameters for your specific model and requirements
   - Set appropriate batch sizes based on GPU memory and performance needs

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add retry logic for failed document processing
   - Implement dead letter queues for unprocessable documents
   - Add monitoring and alerting for pipeline failures

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Tune concurrency settings based on your cluster resources
   - Use appropriate batch sizes for your LLM model
   - Consider data locality and network bandwidth

4. **Monitoring and Observability**:
   - Add metrics collection for processing times and throughput
   - Implement logging for debugging and audit trails
   - Monitor resource utilization (CPU, GPU, memory)

5. **Iceberg Configuration**:
   - Configure Iceberg table properties for your use case
   - Set appropriate partitioning and sorting strategies
   - Configure retention policies and cleanup procedures

6. **Security and Access Control**:
   - Ensure proper IAM roles and permissions for S3 access
   - Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Add access controls for the output Iceberg tables

7. **Scalability**:
   - Test with larger document volumes
   - Monitor cluster autoscaling behavior
   - Optimize for your specific workload patterns
